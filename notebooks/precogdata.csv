#Huge shout out to all donors! This is brilliant! Couple of updates:

1. Dear /u/TheBeginnerr, you have donated enough. Don't bankrupt yourself. The rest of us can continue contributions. No one will think any less of you if you didn't match exact 3x of upvotes.

2. If you post screenshot of your donation (please make sure you hide personal details, transaction ID, bank details etc.) then /u/root_su will gild you. Just our way of saying thanks. We know donating to the cause has higher precedence right now. This is gold credit he already has. Not buying gold right now. 

3. If you have medium of donation that works well for people currently outside India, then please share as a reply to this comment (and tag me). I will update this comment.

**Context:** More than 324 people have died in the worst flooding in nearly a century in the south Indian state of Kerala.

Roads are damaged, mobile phone networks are down, an international airport has been closed and more than 220,000 people have been left homeless after unusually heavy rain in the past nine days.

Officials repeatedly revised the death toll upwards from 86 people on Friday morning to more than 300 by the evening as a massive rescue operation reached more flood-hit regions. “Around 100 people died in the last 36 hours alone,” a state official said.

Casualty numbers are expected to increase further, with thousands more people still stranded and less intense though still heavy rain forecast for at least the next 24 hours. Many have died from being buried in hundreds of landslides set off by the flooding. ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/17/kerala-floods-death-toll-rescue-effort-india))

**Arm chair lawyers read this:** We do not condone karma whoring. But. Butt. But, this post is infinitely more useful than the 'oh look at this pretty photo (I took or I lifted from the internet)' threads. And about admins, yeah, they need to focus on cleaning reddit and get rid of hateful fucks that pose actual threat against people. They should focus on subs dedicated on harassing people. They should focus on subs accommodating and/or encouraging bigotry in the guise of free speech and/or dark humor. This harmless post, an attempt at raising awareness towards actual suffering of actual people should be fine. It ought to be anyway. </rant>


###edit n: Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.

 I'll match your donation, OP

EDIT: Woke up to see this rapidly went out of my *aukaat*, so [here's my meager donation to the cause](https://imgur.com/a/CJykel3). I hope my brothers and sisters from Kerala can forgive me. 

As compensation, I'm going to spend the rest of today and tomorrow volunteering in the collection drives around Hyderabad. If anyone is in town, do come by and drop off anything you can spare. Packaged food, blankets, sanitary pads, and of course water bottles. They never have enough water during the floods. I remember how there were people charging 1000 rupees a bottle during the Uttarakhand floods. 

I will also be asking my friends to donate as much as they can. Cheers and I hope the storm blows over quickly.  Was hoping to match OP's amount, but this is fast going out of my *aukaat*. So here's my contribution: https://i.imgur.com/R7E3btm.png

Godspeed, OP! I want to support my Indian friends but they don’t take my German credit card :(

Done! It’s not much since I’m an average German student (and Jnu alumnus) without much cash

https://i.imgur.com/WiwEWdF.jpg Seeing people donating in such large amount.   

I am feeling guilty of paying just 101 as I can't afford more than that currently.  I pledge to donate at least 10 times the amount of upvotes you get for the post (not this comment). Will wait for a couple days to get the final number.

Will post proof once done.

Edit: [Proof](https://i.imgur.com/s84vq7w.jpg) for the first ₹100,000. Inspired by your post just donated [INR 5000](https://imgur.com/a/C3fIjpe) I wanted to give you Gold for this post but I donated that amount to Kerala. I advise everyone to spend the money where's it's needed the most. Right now it's Kerala. Will match twice the number of upvotes for OP's post (in Rs) in next 24 hours 
Edit: 
Pace of upvotes got scary....
Chickened out at 7.5k upvotes
Proof:

This isn't a bluff.  
You are the man , my man . Late to the party but have already donated 20,000 RS yesterday . Hoping the help really reaches those in need

Proof - http://imgur.com/gallery/lBjMTnD I see several people confused in some other threads on how rain can cause so much damage. I can understand your thoughts as most places do not see this much rain. So, I will explain.

During normal years, Kerala receives the largest rainfall among all major states in India. For comparison, the nearby Tamil Nadu gets 945mm rainfall annually, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Himachal pradesh, Andhra pradesh, MP, J&K, UP, Bihar etc gets some 900mm to 1200mm range rainfall. Haryana, Delhi, Punjab etc get 350mm to 700mm...

If compared with US, california gets 570mm, Iowa gets 850mm, Kentucky	gets 1200mm, Kanas gets 900mm and in general most of USA gets under 1000mm, with the highest being Hawaii at 1600mm. Average for UK is around 850mm. Average for France is 600mm,

Meanwhile the Indian state of Kerala gets about 3000mm average rainfall during ""normal years"". So, by default it is a very rainy place.

Now, what is Kerala(for non Indians). It can be considered as the most developed state of India, with Human development Index more comparable to Europe than to rest of Indian states. It has 100% literacy rates, reasonably good infrastructure and everything is far better than most places in India. Kerala is well known for its natural scenic beauty with [serene backwaters](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=kerala+tourism&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiMsKLRh_TcAhUSfX0KHe3SAHUQ_AUICigB&biw=1229&bih=638) and [cool hills](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=munnar&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiu6rn2h_TcAhUGU30KHR22DrsQ_AUIDCgD&biw=1229&bih=638).

This time, there is non stop rain every few hours daily for like past three months, and that too very strongly.. it is record rain never seen before... most likely it will go in history as the highest rain ever in kerala. Some dam shutters which were NEVER opened in past 40 years had to be opened, and still it is overflowing.

What is the strongest rain you have ever seen? At my place, that strongest rain is continuously falling for past 95 hours straight non-stop... and even before that it was raining heavily every few hours. Even now, it is raining heavily outside. My well has twice more water now than ever seen in history of that well(past 60+years).

We are receiving some 300 to 800% more rain per day than **OUR** normal, throughout the entire state. [source](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/natural-disasters/kerala-received-316-more-rainfall-than-normal-on-august-8-imd-61362)... Think of the heaviest rain you have seen, now think of it with 5 times more intensity, now imagine that rain happening every few hours daily for past 90 days and now you get a picture of what is happening here. The last time a similar sized rain happened was in **1924**, and at that time the entire state had flooded with immense loss. It was so bad that there is a wikipedia entry about it - [Great flood of 99](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_flood_of_99). This time, it could be more intense than that.

The shutters of 35 of the 39 humongous dams in Kerala, including the 123-year-old *Mullaperiyar Dam*, largest earthen dam in India - *Banasura Sagar Dam*, largest reservoir of Kerala - *Malampuzha dam,* highest arch dam of Asia - *Idukki dam* etc have been opened simultaneously for the first time in history. The remaining ones are about to be opened.

And, remember that we are talking about an entire state which is adjacent to the Arabian sea, so most places in Kerala are just barely above sea-level. In fact, the lowest altitude in entire India is in Kuttanad, Kerala and that is **-7.2feet**. That is negative altitude which means it is land which is below sea level.

In so many such places, water **CANNOT** go anywhere. Water which fall on the ground will not go inside earth, instead even if it is not raining, the water will come upwards from the ground even if you cover all sides with walls and drains.

The Kochi airport, which is the fourth busiest airport in India by international traffic, has been shut down till August 26 due to this problem. Its elevation is mere 5m from sea level, and water is not going down into earth, so the runway has been flooded!

Now, how do people die due to rain? Most of the deaths are due to landslides caused by the rain, or houses collapsing due to rain taking away the foundation of the house. Few people have have drowned and few have been electrocuted, but those cases are rare.

The death toll is around 175 as of now. This is not as high as some other disaster struck zones around the world because Kerala is a pretty well managed state, and is perhaps the best state in India to handle heavy rainfall and floods, as rain is usual for Kerala and so everything is designed around it with age-old drainage systems throughout the state. But, every system has a limit, and that limit has been far exceeded now.

The government also handled the situation very well with optimally opening dams and conducting the rescue operation and evacuation at the right time. However, the loss to the state is immense, with the current estimate going over 8000 crore.

So, when Kerala says rains are heavy, the rains are really really heavy, and we are talking about catastrophic levels.

Google donations works like charm. if this post is in violation of any rules then mods plz delete it. OP, we are with you. Folks this kind of unconditional support is inspiring. If OP finds this beyond his means reply here and we will all will split it with him. Comment if you're in!

Edit: OP, hope you're not overwhelmed by this. Really would hate you having stress for your good work. Just let us know if you need help.
I have already donated 5k as of now (proof: https://imgur.com/a/zeS2Vm7), but we're here for you if you need
 OP how does your thoracic cavity have any space for lungs, with a heart that is so big!
Thanks for inspiring us to donate.  Was planning to donate 2-3k but this thread inspired me to [make it 10k] (https://imgur.com/a/MzQHzYo). Maybe it has even opened my mind to make larger donations hereon for any cause. Experienced working professional here, so money's not an issue but always used to be unsure and conservative about these donations. Count me in as well.

[here's my contribution as well. but i did it a bit before OP's thread. ](https://i.imgur.com/ZN1HJCW.png) Well, am in too. Added 5k more just now. Total 10k. Maximum I could do.  [Proof](https://imgur.com/a/ns3JHju)

This is an inspiring thread. Kudos to all who donated.

Thanks to all the people in this thread for donating and encouraging others to donate as well. I love Randia in times like these.
All the complaining and the bitching is forgotten and you guys showed up and did your part even though you didn't need to, when the country needed you. You're all amazing Donated [Some](https://imgur.com/a/4eIUD3w).

Thank You /u/TheBeginnerr and /r/india for the inspiration.  I've been to some of those flooded places and I really wish I could donate more.

https://imgur.com/a/UqrAy0V

Also donated few blankets through Amazon.
 Added another [5k](https://imgur.com/a/I4JhUcB), after getting inspired from this thread. Great work op. My post backfired but hey, at least there will be people helped: https://i.imgur.com/ZYxsX7Y.png 
Donated 15'000 in goods [Thank you all.](https://imgur.com/a/EEc9Ezg)  [Going through tough times at the moment. This is all could donate. will get my friends to contribute.](https://i.imgur.com/VYmA4L0.jpg)

Edit - thank you so much for doing this OP. [Donated ₹1000](https://i.imgur.com/Dug8WKM.jpg) via Tez. Need to check my budget and expenditure and see if I can donate more. Used the CM Disaster Relief Fund site to donate. [Proof](https://imgur.com/a/rWzB0xb).

Thank you [/u/TheBeginnerr](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheBeginnerr) and [/u/root\_su](https://www.reddit.com/u/root_su) for taking the lead.  Guys the estimated loss is above 19500 Crores :( Don't have any money to donate(am unemployed) .. so gave 15 pairs of clothes to an ngo. [Proof](https://i.imgur.com/ONtWf54.jpg) Donated [1k](https://i.imgur.com/wbNadyA.png). Good work OP! Can someone please explain one thing to me? I get that this donation will really help rebuild and rehabilitate the people affected by the floods. No doubts there. But why is the CM (correct me if I am wrong) fund dependant on our donations? Doesn't our government have enough money to foot the bill in the case of a natiral disaster? Have already donated but will match it.

Edit:
Had donated items worth INR 20,000 to Goonj through Amazon earlier. Donated the rest 30,000 to CMDRF - [proof](https://imgur.com/a/MA4IWpL) [deleted] Rest in RIP op salary.

PS: don't give me reddit gold, already have it. Rather donate that money. I must say OP and this thread inspired me. I did my bit, donated 10K by selecting SBI EPAY from https://donation.cmdrf.kerala.gov.in. After successful transaction, when it redirected back to CMDRF websites, it timed out (mostly due to high volume of traffic) and now I am unable to search/download receipt from here https://donation.cmdrf.kerala.gov.in/index.php/Settings/payment_list I hope it is used for people in need. Yay! This is the most upvoted post of r/india till 18/Aug/18 This thread is an absolute good. This thread is Life. Not much but donated 200₹[https://i.imgur.com/U2K1SBa.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/U2K1SBa.jpg) Good going everyone, 400k and counting.

Adding my [contribution](https://i.imgur.com/ovaqNKk.png) of 1k made yesterday before I noticed this thread.

Please do not gild as I won't be using the features. Just like everyone else, mine is [not much](https://i.imgur.com/SBdFUmo.png) but every bit counts, so yeah. Thanks to op and r/India, I wouldnt have donated otherwise.  So I paid from Tez and got ₹22 reward. Transferred that too 😇

[Confirmation](https://i.imgur.com/w2xY52W.jpg) OP you've started something phenomenal. Kudos to you man!

[My bit.](https://imgur.com/a/Nk4ZthL) I will donate the amount of upvotes of the post.
Am broke so cannot triple. Cheers mate I am a college student, and not able to pay a large amount. I donated Rs. 200. Thanks for bringing this up. Donated 5k to the relief fund.

I [Donated 10k](https://i.imgur.com/hCXtAMC.png). Very easy to donate via [CM's Relief Fund](https://donation.cmdrf.kerala.gov.in/). International credit cards are accepted as well - [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/IEGBWLg.png) To those who can't donate much like the good people here have shown:

Don't worry. Do what you can, and if you can't, it's alright. Don't overdo it.

  


Also, good on everyone here! I am a student so that's all I could afford right now.[Proof](https://i.imgur.com/kj1eOzW.jpg)

Congrats everyone!

Before anyone thinks its an iphone x, its not. Its a xiaomi phone

And don't gild, I dont use reddit often. Rather donate that money Meanwhile Carryminati raised about 2000$ in his live stream for Kerala I just made a donation too via google. Hope you guys do the same. https://imgur.com/Xx2Ku6g I hadn't heard of this before, but sounds like a good cause. Thanks OP! Hope we can get lots of upvotes in here This is awesome! As a keralite I thank each one of you who donated and gave us support. This means a lot to us. I know it's little but that's all I can do for now. 

http://imgur.com/gallery/a6x88Mf As somebody from Kerala I can only say thank you brothers [I hope this Helps. :)](https://imgur.com/a/1YKJBOp) are we going to forget Kodugu and half of south Karnataka.. where the water from the Kerala dam coupled with heavy down pour is literally erasing hills and causing acres of landslides? has already flattened most of Kodagu (koorg) This thread bought a tear to my eyes :) Well done everyone! Thanks OP for the inspiration. Donated and did my part.

https://imgur.com/a/1O3A0J8 This man deserves a permanent special flair on r/india.
 

Also why The Office links OP?  Did my small part by donating 1000 rupees on paytm http://imgur.com/KcMPHlE Just did my bit. Wasn't much but hope it will help.  Great thread.

Proud of you OP I did mine :)[1k](https://i.imgur.com/7viQRYV.jpg) I did it through transfer wise. How would I know if my donation reached? Do I have to believe transfer wise when it says funds reached. Just a bit paranoid. Cheers

Edit. Proof. https://imgur.com/gallery/YtMSjDU >bankruptcy

  


OP, don't go overboard donating. You already have donated a substantial amount. It doesn't matter if you donated exactly the amount you claimed to donate or less.

  


You have done your bit. Your post has motivated and still motivating hundreds of people like me to donate. So no need to zeroing on your bank account. 


Thank you very much. Guys, contribute as much as you can, even if its 1 rupee. We'll need it to rebuild our homes. Believe me when I say this, almost everyone in Kerala is affected by this one way or the other.
I wish I could [donate](https://imgur.com/sxvXCnr) more. 
  


If you are unable to donate money, contribute by giving away necessary goods for relief camps. There are various drop points being opened all across major cities by various NGOs. I'll try to link some. To start with, you can check out anbodukochi Instagram handle. They are doing a stellar job. I will try to add in more details, as soon as I can.



If you are in Kerala, and is in a safe place. Try volunteering at your nearest relief camp. People need all the help we can provide. 

 Donated  2000 Rs. 

 I would donate 70% of my monthly salary for the next few months.  But I have a hard time trusting govt and other NGOs with money.  Good thing is that donation is fully exempt upto 1.5 lakh ₹ under Section 80G of Income Tax Act, So donations you make goona come back in a sense. I just made my contribution Rs.2000

Edit : Couldn't match OP's contribution exactly, but mine was Rs. 31, 544/-
My personal choice was to donate goods using Amazon, instead of transferring money. Here's proof of the payment and orders : https://imgur.com/a/jB3vjSE OP Ummmaaaaaa 😘😘😘

I'll match your donation Rain has been wrecking havoc here in Nagaland too.. Causing massive landslides, property , crop fields damages...but the amount of havoc its causing in Kerala is saddening.... Prayers and best wishes for everyone out there.  Great. I donated 10k two days ago. Hope everyone will help in every way possible. You’re awesome,OP! Donated a small amount.

http://imgur.com/gallery/k1kthRZ Well done my friend . I was about to join my old hobby after 3 year now i think it can wait for a while. This whole thread is the fucking best. You go guys! Donated before this post. Saw your post and donated the same amount again. Thanks for the inspiration. Somebody post this somewhere else like r/wholesomememes or r/humansbeingbros or something like that and let's make a game where people donate a percentage of the upvotes on their comments, if they are willing to participate.

I am not doing it, because I am not well versed in Reddit. But , what do you think? Zomato has also stared flood relief operation. Open the order online app and donate money for food. Good job man.... I hope everyone get drunk like him! Try PAYTM, they are matching the donations so 18k will be actually 36k. Goddammit! I am not able to make any sort of contributions as of now. But I swear, as soon as I am able to make money, I am gonna donate to charity every single month. Thanks OP, and all other people who are donating and spreading the word. 
Just donated my bit: proof - https://imgur.com/CKFGAlt Donated as well. Feels like a drop in a ~~bucket~~ ocean. I know, every bit helps. But I can't shake off the feeling that there's more that we can do. Hey guys you can now donate using google Tez or any UPI app. I just donated 1000 bucks and it was seamless.  Jesus man, great job! I mean that doesn't even begin to cover the extent of your magnanimity...however may I know the story behind the 69 Rs. donation?  [deleted] Site was getting hammered. Finally was able to donate in cash. We have been collecting stuff and handling over to Wayanad. u/mirandasghost On top of r/all we go! 1.5k upvotes in 3 hours. Not bad. Yay. Currently on 50 at r/all. 2150 IST OP,  just a heads up.

If possible, Try doing it via Paytm, they are matching each donation. Rupee for Rupee.
 Muthanu nee!!!

Thank you man! Unfortunately I have a federal bank account which is not functional at the moment. (Online banking is dysfunctional). Could someone suggest different means through which I can make a donation. TIA. [Done.](http://imgur.com/gallery/FtylMcY) Do it man! Good job! Great job op. C'mon radians , let's take this to the front page and atleast get 20k+ upvotes. Decades down the line, books of history will tell this tale to our future generations.  Hello fellow Keralan (Keralite?). Thanks for being a good person. My mom was freaking out a couple days ago because our family in Kerala weren't answering their phone. I guess I didn't really understand what the big deal was. Thanks for putting things into perspective.

Edit: So my aunt says that the real death toll is around 10,000. And the gov't isn't releasing this number because it would cause panic. She says that a lot of people are stuck in their houses with dead bodies and can't contact anyone. Can anyone tell me if this is bullshit. It doesn't sound right to me. My friends are sending in packages with food, water and blankets. Anything we can add that people often overlook? Like someone suggested sugar free food for diabetic folks. Any input is appreciated!  Upvote for using the word thrice. I'm sorry to hear about the tragedy, I hope all the people of India are safe from the monsoons/rains.

Love you my friend, and thank you. Good job OP! Your post has started a wave that I hope won’t stop till Kerala can rest easy. Don’t take everything on yourself if it’s too much. We all are here.  well i can say i donated three bucks Sir, I respect you. Albeit I wish you had done this sober, you are a good man for donating.   Also, people working in corporates, chances are your org is doing something like this too. Shoot an email to HR asking how you can help.

Mine asked for goods and groceries.  Wow, this is amazing! Can't believe OP and so many others kept their word. I think we can actually say ""We did it, Reddit!"" unironically. Guys if one wishes to donate goods  through that link what would be the useful item? god bless you What's the best way to donate for those overseas? Stay strong.  Not earning much right now as I'm on the lowest point of my career as far as sales are concerned. But did what I can. Sharma ji ka beta dekho donete shonete kar rha Don't have a rokda rn but well done  op for making so much effort for another state. I wish these billionaires donate a crore or two, wouldn't affect them one bit. I took a screenshot of full website in case it goes down again. It contains various payment options.

You’re awesome op. Im thinking ""Lets bankrupt this b""....but im just drunk and broke
 Huh. I just spent a rupee On r/all . Woohooo F No bamboozling OP! Donated some money with PayTM!

Use PayTM  guys, they are matching your donation. what % of our per month salary should we donate? Thank you all kind souls for the love and support pouring upon us... Good to see everyone help out. I'll pray no matter what the up votes, as I'm unable to help financially 3.45 crores of Keralite hearts beating as one. Let me be philosophical a little because it indeed is true.  Time to open my alt accounts password containing notepad file. 

Mate, Get ready to declare bankruptcy.  Stellar job op, instead of the million prayers and thoughts wishes you actually did something.  [deleted] I have a genuine question here. How can we be sure that all the funds donated are aptly used by the government for citizen welfare? How can we be sure that funds are not misused by middlemen or by the government? I want to donate but I hope it doesn't go to some rich politician's pocket. This is a genuine question and I want to donate. So I hope somebody can provide a proper answer. This is really good! We need this kind of positive competition! bamboozle insurance? [OP has a bookmark named xvid and a lot of New Folders. Hmmmm](https://imgur.com/AfvqJaN) /r/BestOf we need upvotes.

"If you are not moved by this picture, I wish I had your heart. [NP]  Such parents are not commonly found in India. God bless you Man, I wish more Indian parents were supportive of their kids. It makes a huge difference when your parents back you up rather than when you have to fight every battle on your own. More Indian parents need to move ahead from the ""khane mein kya khaya"" bullshit and need to know what their kids actually feel. The number of times I have cried my heart out in my own house and not told my parents about it is too high. The parent-kid relationship in this country is so messed up.  The guy in question is an acquaintance of mine, from college. Always been someone who you'd watch out for, because of his energy. And boy oh boy, it was so cool to see all the support that poured out for him! Sad that a normal human could be termed a criminal for what their sexual preference was until now. Indeed history owes an apology to everyone of those who were harassed, mistreated, jailed, beaten or shunned by us. Amazing man 👍🏼 [Here's the story](https://indianexpress.com/article/trending/trending-in-india/gay-man-coming-out-story-with-supportive-parents-viral-post-5344801/) You wish you had the heart of people who are **not moved** by this picture?

Three cases:

1. You made a typo
2. You are a psychopath
3. I made an error in understanding the title r/MadeMeSmile

Thank you for this, OP. I was having a rough day, not anymore.  Your parents are awesome! Love to your family ♥️ So happy for India!! Great pic. Crap title.  Love from Belgium! 🇧🇪 I loved what one judge, D.Y. Chandrachud said on Thursday. He said, ""We must as a society ask searching questions to the forms and symbols of injustice. Unless we do that, we risk becoming the cause and not just the inheritors of an unjust society.""

LGBTQs finally to some extent have the dignity to to live a life without fear, a right to choose love and express themselves. As a 22 year old straight man often hearing news of couples of my age getting killed or disowned because of not belonging to same caste, religion etc, this news makes me so happy. So heart-warming!!! Congratulations! :)  Love from Holland 🌷 Parents Love <3 Title gore? Nice picture nonetheless  I hope that their courage is contagious. It took me a second to make the connection that he’s gay and that was just decriminalized. At first I was like, “did he just get out of prison?” Your Son was never a criminal for being what he was.  [removed] [deleted] :')  More like he never was. An inhumane and obsolete backward law cannot be the legal compass on the sexuality of a human being.  Indian parents hardly accept intercaste marriages. 
So intra-gender marriage is gonna go fine. 

Congratulations man and Family respect +9999. Okay. The caption does not need to be so dramatic. But I do love this! <3 This picture made me emotional. 
And such parents are an inspiration... as a 28 year old today, I don’t hope my parents’ generation to change their mindset overnight . However I sincerely wish that parents of my generation embrace this for our kids to come So great to see, too many countries still have outdated laws and mindsets.  India may be a different country. India may be a dirtier country than others. India may even have lesser infrastructure.

But it is still the world’s largest democracy. It is still a bastion for freedom. And it will cohere. Was the government actually prosecuting anyone under the law? Because to me it seems like the rural folk living in isolated villages wont give a fuck about what the government says  they'll cut your head off without a second thought. Hats off to parents for being this supportive. Is there some context to this picture? Wholesome! :') I feel proud by just looking at this picture. Thanks Guys.  Can anyone share some light on why he isn’t a Criminal anymore? Did something happen recently in India that would’ve made him a criminal? Sorry, I just don’t know what’s going on in this picture  Their son is not a criminal.  Full stop.  Never was. After watching that sad kitty video earlier and crying quite a bit over it, this has really turned my day around emotionally. Bloody good job parents! So.....you want my heart now or what? Psychopath  if i became a criminal my parents will just throw me away  He's lucky that they are his parents! So cringey. So yesterday if his dad had to hold up a sign would it have said ""my son is a criminal""? Did he need the Supreme Court to say it for him to realise this? However I appreciate his dad for playing along, including the homosexuality bit. You can have my heart.  The guy was my senior in college. A really cool person to be around. I'm not moved This made my day! Nothing short of emotional blackmailing can be expected from most things Indian, and most Indians.

I am not moved and I dont care . Give a shit about what's good or bad about whatever you love to call them- Homosexuals or whatever.

Why cant your question be specific- For those who are Homos or related to ,**If you are not moved by this picture, I wish I had your heart.**

It would have been rational. Why try to blackmail just every one who is either not part of that phenomenon or not related directly to those with the phenomenon called homosexuality ?

Why this craziness to over socialize when it has no practical connection to other's lives ? Miss me with that gay shit This makes me very proud, what great parents.  This ""you should be moved everytime there's something about LGBTQ"" is backwards too.

They're people with equal rights. Didn't have it, but got now. We moved court and are resting now. It's part of normal life now.

So No, I'm not moved by it one iota and I still do have a heart.

p.s:- i really need it [removed] Moving beyond words- the love of his mom and dad, and the humanity of it all - proud day for India  Beautiful family! Cheers Wait so you wish you were cold-hearted? Or didn’t care about other people? That’s kinda fucked up... You wish you had a callous heart? Is this real?  Why would you want a cold heart OP?  Hell Yeah !  
Such parents are not usally found in India. God bless you  I think that one could argue that having something as innate and natural as sex with your loved one being characterized as an act against nature could be called punishment or persecution.

As you said, it was colonial bullshit and now it's gone. I have a soft spot for Indians and this just melts my heart❤️ This is silly. 

He never was a criminal - and, as parents, to suggest otherwise is silly. 

However, this being india, i guess even baby steps in the right direction is good for all of us. Good for you but this whole Facebook kind of “sentimental “ stuff is not needed. It could have been a normal title but you butchered it. 

I’m not bothered about homosexuals, congratulations to them about what happened yesterday anyway. 

One more thing, why is everyone saying that homosexuality has been decriminalised? It has always been like that, it just got amended. 
 He is my college senior. I'm so happy for him! Why do you want my cold wretched heart.

Just kidding, nice picture, but this belongs on facebook not reddit. I'm not moved by it but ok Your son was never a criminal. Your government are the criminals.  😍😍😍 Whoa !! This is soo wholesome !  This is wholesome. Happy for guy and his parents. Just to state my position on the debate, let me start by saying that I'm your textbook dudely dude with zero queer inclinations.

Having said that, I congratulate all you guys on this victory. I really don't want to know what you do in your 'free time' because that's none of my business. I'm safe and comfortable in my orientation and I'm not a #sanskaari-chachaji, so I don't get all worked up about queer people queering about.

Real men don't care about these things. They respect other people as they expect to be respected themselves.

Happy independence day. Go enjoy your life and don't let anybody take your happiness away from you. [deleted] Is someone cutting onions in here? I forgot the context of India's recent legal changes, so I was really concerned about the 'anymore' for a moment.

Like, if you've commited a crime like murder or robbery, the 'anymore' doesn't mean very much.

With the context though it's a happy picture. Congratulations! That’s really heart warming, I really hope some other countries start to follow suit... [deleted] Hey u/Whatay what is it that you or your son (idk which of you posted this) were accused of being a criminal of? Were you falsely accused and proven innocent? Why didn't you add this info in the title! Everyone seems to be all heart warmed in the comments but no one says what crime you stopped committing. Either way good for you!  Love it. Why do you wish for my heart? The fact is that it is a much more complex notion to prove someone isn't than it is to prove they are. Why would you want my heart?

It’s bad enough that war carries with it the heavy losses that it does but uncorroborated news spreading faster than fire on news channels and social media is going to make this way worse.  republic says 'we stand with forces'

yet the one guy who was most effected by today has got the least coverage on your channel.  People on my family group are forwarding messages like ""in case of war, it can turn nuclear. Be prepared""

lmao be prepared with what? Patanjali ki cream se radiation marega kya?

Indian people haven't properly been educated about nuclear bombs. Most think it's like any other patakha ""Bharat ne chhuraaye Pakistan ke chhakke, shanti ki beek maang raha hai Pakistan""

This is the trash we are shown on TVs

Source: ABP News As an Indian living in the UK, it's so frustrating trying to figure out the truth of what actually took place. On India's side it's 'We killed 300 terrorists' while on Pakistan's side it's just memes about them missing and hitting trees.

Now India is claiming technical faults crashed a plane, and that India downed an F-16, while Pakistan claims they shot down 2 jets and captured 1 pilot.

Fucking sad seeing chest-thumping going on on both sides, and any questioning of the official narrative on both sides leads to accusations of treason. I just want to know what the fuck happened. 'Imran Khan Addresses Pakistani and Indian People' Summary:

&#x200B;

1. Wars are fought on miscalculations. No one thought WWI, WWII, War on Terror, Vietnam War, etc. would escalate over the years. Can India and Pakistan afford a miscalculation? 
2. Terrorism is not in the interest of Pakistan (on our own land or on others land); we are focusing on economy.
3. Pulwama was a tragedy for the Indian people.  I asked for evidence and joint investigation between Pakistan and India. We are willing to help you in anyway. You don't have the right to be judge, jury and executioner on our land.
4. You challenged our sovereignty and violated LoC. We did the same. We wanted to show that we are also capable if you want to escalate things.
5. There was some conflict in the air; Indian people lost two aircrafts. Their pilots are with us.
6. Lets talk about our issues and focus on peace, not war. Things are escalating. I hope we don't go at war. Nothing good comes out of wars.

Edit: Seeing the released video of our captured pilot is so gut wrenching. I don't know what to feel.

Edit 2: At this point, with so much of false information being released, I'm beginning to question the evidence of every news report. Confused.

Edit 3: Lost one MiG 21, Pilot MIA confirmed during conference. 

Edit 4: 1 PAK AF Jet shot down confirmed during conference

Edit 5: 2 terrorists killed, confirmed or not? It was mentioned in the conference.  I can confirm that the captured pilot in the twitter video is indeed an Indian flying pilot. He is my classmates husband Abhinandan. I have attended their wedding and i do remember him very clearly. Please don't be war. Please. [BBC is claiming that Pakistan has captured two India Jets but other news sources are claiming the opposite. ](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47383634?ocid=socialflow_twitter)

The fuck is happening? 


Edit: [Link to Zee news article about India capturing a Pakistani Jet](https://zeenews.india.com/india/live-updates/iaf-airstrikes-on-jem-terror-camps-in-pakistan-and-reactions-live-updates-2183757)



Edit 2: [Here's BBC website with live updates](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-asia-47383889)


Edit 3: From the article in Edit 2,


> Maj Gen Ghafoor also said Pakistan could have inflicted damage, ""but we don't want to go on the path of war"".


Also, Pakistan is claiming that no F-16 fighter jets was shot down and none was used in this operation  I really hope that if there is an arrest of Indian pilot, we own it. I don't want to be the country that can't respect their soldiers' martyrdom to win a propaganda war.  This will be full on propaganda from both sides now on and I won’t believe either unless I see a downed enemy aircraft, a captured/dead pilot/ a video of an aircraft being shot down. This goes for both indian and pakistani claims. I feel sad, really sad for the pilot MIA. Even in the video, he knows he can be tortured and roughed and face the fate of Sarabjeet or Kulbhushan but still he puts a brave face to say 'I can't tell you that' and adds a Sir salutation. That's just heartbreaking for me.

I really hope Imran offers to return him as a show of good faith and we can give peace a chance before this escalates. I wish FB and Twitter didn't exist. 18 years ago the situation wouldn't be this bad and I know that because 18 years ago we shot down a PAF airplane and everything was solved diplomatically. There was no stupid idiots asking for a war. I don't think this act will result in war but it sure is fueling the flames and will act as a catalyst.


Going to war is a humongous decision so we have to wait and see how all of this will play. 

But it sure looks like that Pakistan is pushing their luck. One thing is certain - there's no shortage of social media warriors on both sides. An old video of the pilot 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZitItZ8lFk Just reading this thread has been crazy, from no IAF pilots aren't allowed mustaches to ok that's one of ours Fuck all the media channels. Literally fuck them. No facts just constant warmongering, all in the name of TRP/agenda. The Pakistani military now has Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman under custody. He is a MiG 21 pilot. This is confirmed. I'm in a Liberal Pakistani group on fb and most of the people there are saying the pilot should be treated with respect and handed over quick. Just shows that not all Pakistanis are terrorists or want war.  A lot of people here seem to be of the opinion that the capture of our brave soldier(s) was Pakistan getting ""lucky"". Though that might be the case, I don't think it is. And it might be disrespectful to consider it so. 

I wrote this as a response to another comment here, and I thought I'll just share it again:

> I know people keep using the words ""lucky"" whenever the enemy does well. 

> I am an Indian. And I absolutely believe that our country is better than theirs in many fields and points of comparison. Our army is better and stronger than theirs. And our airforce is as well, of course. I am not sure of our political class -- but I would suspect, as a whole, even that is better than its Pakistani counterpart. (Unnecessary joke) perhaps one of the places where they are better than us is Coke Studio. 

> But back to the topic at hand: 

> We released no proof of the damage we did with our strike yesterday, and I am beginning to think that we didn't achieve much (other than, of course, show that we are capable and willing of cross border airforce-led skirmishes). The 300 to 600 terrorists being killed is most certainly an exaggeration. Propaganda as well. Of course, the Government didn't give that figure. But many Indians believe it. 
The Pakistanis believe we hit some trees. The truth, as it is in most cases, might rest between the claims for both sides. 

> Today, when they countered (which they said they would), they claim they intentionally hit no target but were there to show that they can. We claim that we foiled their attempts to hit their real target. (Here, I'm not too sure what to believe.)

> However, in the pursuit that followed thereafter, it looks like a well-tested and age-old Milliatry tactic was used by them -- famously used by the Mongols very often. 

> Their jets retreated. Ours went in after them (crossing the LOC again). And this time, they were ready with their defences. A trap was laid, and we fell for it. They egged us to follow them back, and in our pursuit, shot us down. 

> Of course, they knew we would be on high alert. And we would scramble our jets. 

> This doesn't feel like ""luck"". It feels calculated. 

> Undermining and underestimating them does us no good. In a way, it disrespects our own military -- our defense forces aren't fighting a mentally challenged enemy. The threat is real and capable. 

> Both are militaries aren't the best (though I know ours is stronger). But both are war hardened. Both are capable. 

> I just hope we de-escalate immediately. This war will destroy us both.  If they return the pilot in goodwill resulting in de-escalation the whole incident could be a blessing in disguise. Ok someone please STFU the media. They are creating chaos among the people. The Ind-Pak issue is just free content for them. Live Flight Tracking of aircraft PS392 entering Pakistan territory. 

Video: [https://imgur.com/a/TzOMZgG](https://imgur.com/a/TzOMZgG)

Video of the same plane earlier approaching Pakistani border north: [https://imgur.com/a/9bDVtOA](https://imgur.com/a/9bDVtOA) I think stepping one step back would be wise move here. But the question is will modi step back? He may be fearing to do so because he does not want to be labeled as coward. Let's hope he does not get flown away with rage and run behind the votes and put India into jeopardy as elections are also  coming.   I’m livid that some Indian media are more focused on criticizing Congress and calling for retaliation and NONE of them are hoping for Wing Commander Abhi to come home.  If the person captured indeed is an Indian Pilot and government is downplaying the incident, then what difference do we have between us and Pakistan? Why the fuck they didn't acknowledge earlier and released false statement that all pilots are accounted for. so where are we on the 'no moustache' and 'no names on the uniform' argument, guys? fucking peddlers of fake news ""Pakistan has stopped domestic and international flight operations from Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, Sialkot and Islamabad airports.""

-- The Telegraph

https://twitter.com/ttindia/status/1100657233325477888 dude on aaj tak saying the captured pilot is actually a pakistani. imagine you're the pilot's kid. imagine someone not just refusing to acknowledge your father's existence but flat out branding him a pakistani WITHOUT proof. games people play for ratings. we don't deserve free speech.  The worst part amidst this chaos is trying to find the real source of information. I don't even know where to go and which website, news officials to trust.  Can our media for once act like a fucking responsible grownup? 

&#x200B;

Teach/Preach why wars are bad. Doesn't matter which nation wins, its the citizens that are on the losing side. Not to forget the economic shocks the wars give. Sends us back by another 15-20 years. 

&#x200B;

And God forbid if either of us uses Nukes, god! Most people really dont know how bad Nukes are. The ones on twitter act like they should be the ones calling the shots. 

&#x200B;

Also, will media preaching help? It might calm the public which in turn will reduce the pressure on the government.  Can anyone tell me how reliable the info from flightradar24 is? In the last 30mins, I saw 2 Indian military planes take off, one fly along the Pakistani border and the other fly directly towards the border. I deadass watched the second plane’s flight entry change to an international flight with no callsign, then both planes disappeared off the radar. Used the replay feature on the website to confirm.

Paranoid/10.

Edit: According to another redditor Planes were Indian Air Force, second plane changed to a Ukrainian 747 before both disappeared.

Not saying they were shot down, just they aren’t appearing on the map anymore.

I’ll verify in a bit.

Edit2: Planes were IAF Antonov An-32RE from Adampur and Ilyushin Il-76MD from unknown location. Upon further review, the second plane disappears from radar while an international flight with no callsign seems to be flying in a parallel flight plan in close proximity. The *new* second plane icon continues on course for a while until the icon flys around erratically all over map and disappears, so it’s hard to determine if the aircraft was there to begin with. Was confusing watching it live. I saw a C17 Globemaster in there somewhere. For anyone worried about a Nuclear war-its not gonna happen.

India has a no first use policy i.e we won't launch our nukes first in an offensive against another country. Our nukes are primarily there for MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) i.e if you nuke us we will destroy you.

Meanwhile, Pakistan definitely doesn't want to get wiped off the face of the earth. The primary reason they developed nukes was so that there wouldn't be another situation like 1971, where we overpowered them in conventional war and they lost half of their country i.e they won't use nukes unless they are under risk of occupation-which I don't think India wants to do.

The only scenario I'm worried about is terrorists using nukes. Hopefully Pakistan, Isi or the army or whoever is in control is sensible enough to not hand a nuke to a terrorist organisation.  One thing is sure - Our media is SHIT! Absolute garbage I have to say, yesterday the Pakistani government and military were looking like utterly incompetent fools while India was looking organised and professional. Now the situation is totally reversed.

Multiple aircrafts crashing, not sure if its from Pakistani firing or technical problems, lack of communication from the government and no statement from the leader of our country. Meanwhile the media is doing god know what, reporting bullshit and inventing stuff out of thin air. Everything looks to be disorganized and in disarray.

This is 1/3rd the Government's fault and 2/3rds the media fault. The government should have gotten ahead of all the rumours and put rest to any speculation. They should reassure the citizens and tell them what has happened.

Meanwhile, the media needs to shut the fuck up about things that they don't know about. This is what happens when your primary concern is being nationalistic instead of being objective. Like the government never even quoted a figure saying how many terrorists were killed and the news channels in an effort to outdo other channels and be the first, starts saying a bullshit figure of 300. Even in victory they're making us look like fools.  P L E A S E    D E - E S C A L A T E!

The only people who want war are the ones who haven't experienced it first hand. One thing this has shown is that both India and Pakistan have huge issues with sensationalized media. It seems like this is a very dangerous time to be doing that. If they did capture the pilot as it appears to be, then India will have no option but to either capitulate, or to escalate. 

Can't capitulate because the public will chew Modi alive. If they escalate then we're fucked
 Tv Media still makes no fucking mention of the pilot and is celebrating downing of f-16 (still rumoured) wtf Fuck Indian media all their ""experts"". How can they be so fucking dogshit. bjp's javdekar shows clip of pakistani news channel in live press conn. ANI cuts the feed 'cause of broadcasting ethics(inciteful content). what a clusterfuck. Can't believe THIS is the government's priority now.  Watching several sources. Every media house spreading hatred without reason is doing a major disservice to our country. This is the harsh reality. I know some may not like these words. 

Even if we go to war, we don’t have to stoop to such lowly levels of hateful rhetoric. We are better than this India.  Just went to Twitter for a sec. (fuck twitter, I know) 

God damn people are riled up...  and war thirsty there Politics is war without bloodshed, while war is politics with bloodshed.

Mao Zedong Why is India using Mig21 bisons in a modern combat situation? It was designed in the late 50s. Pakistan’s F16s, which were built in the 70s are far superior to the Mig21. 

We have newer aircraft. It’s almost like India just expected Pakistan to not respond. This is unacceptable when pilot’s lives are at stake  Imran Khan calls for a peace talk and Arnab Goswami titles it as, ""Imran Khan begs to India"". Fucking cunt. This warmonger should be behind the bars. Pakistan has denied targetting any military or civilian areas.

But,

MEA just emphasised that Pakistan tried to target ""Military Installments"".

This will only get worse. All I know is that a war is going to be hell. Most of us never went through a condition of national emergency like the older generation did. I wish it stays that way.  all things said and done , maybe pakistan is aware of what danger hey have called for , maybe they are afraid.

but they are acting too  mature , their media too in spite of celebrating as our media is doing kalse , they are talking about **peace** and acting very Mature I can hear jets flying overhead. This is not over yet. I hope that the pilots will be safe.

Edit: I don't wanna give away the location but all I can say is that its a major airbase. im neither indian or pakistani but I pray for both sides today, please no war. Quick question-  
Would the IAF/GoI release proof of casualties from the Balakot strike yesterday, even if they did have it?  


Pak PM in his speech mentions that there were no casualties and hence they intended no collateral damage either. Tweets from Pak claim that we only hit trees and barren land ([https://twitter.com/AsadHashim/status/1100727906249179137](https://twitter.com/AsadHashim/status/1100727906249179137)).   


If the strike actually caused terrorist casualties, it is certain that Pak would deny having had terrorists on their soil close to a military establishment.   


But would the Indian government release any such proof if they did have it? India media bodies claiming the 300 number, have no government source.  
 Can we exchange Commander Abhinandan with studio warmongers? Every single Indian, especially the ones calling for full out war, should redirect their energy and ask why the fuck the IAF is flying Mig-21s in combat. A fucking 56 year old, soviet plane.  ""Call on both sides to show restraint. Ready to further assist in strengthening counter-terrorism potential of New Delhi and Islamabad"": Russia's statement amid escalating tensions between India and Pakistan 

LIVE updates here: 

https://twitter.com/ndtv/status/1100741436381659137?s=19 IAF says all pilots accounted for Imran Khan, PM of Pakistan just gave a press conference. He said: 

We told India, if you do something, we will have to retaliate. I don't have an option but to retaliate if you violate our sovereignty. No country can be ""Judge, Jury, and Executioner"". I still knew they would do something because they are about to have elections. We had to do this. We tried to do no collateral damage. We didn't do anything yesterday because no one on our side died yesterday so it would not be fair to attack without knowing the overall situation.

We must use wisdom. Wars are started with miscalculations. World war 1 was a miscalculation. World war 2 was a miscalculation. America's war on terror and Vietnam war was a miscalculation. World's history tells us not to start wars. 

I want to ask India, where do we go from here? I want to ask, the type of weapons we have, can we afford a miscalculation? If we escalate, it will be out of my control and it would be out of your control. 

I want to repeat again, we are saddened by Pulwama tragedy. If you have some method to tackle terrorism, I am ready for dialogue. I am still waiting. Nevertheless, we should use diplomacy. Taliban advising india and pak to calm the fuck down.

It has come to this dear sub-continent that was once cradle of civilizations. Chain of events

1. Pakistan Air Force fires across LoC from 3 aircrafts, from their own airspace, in a show of strength. India claims target were military installations which were missed, Pakistan claims it targeted open space (source: [ANI](https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1100650778451238912), [Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/pakistan-violates-air-space-in-poonch-rajouri-nowshera-jammu-kashmir-india-pakistan-5602659/))
2. India shoots down one PAF F-16, it goes down in PoK (source: [ANI](https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1100644064452472832)). **Confirmed:** PAF jet [shot down](https://twitter.com/IndianExpress/status/1100695109622845440) by MiG-21 Bison (not F-16 as initially reported).
3. India crosses LoC in retaliation, 2 IAF jets shot down. One goes down in Indian territory, one in PoK. **2 IAF pilots** captured by Pakistan (source: [Pakistan Armed Forces](https://twitter.com/OfficialDGISPR/status/1100641491679150080), [Geo News](https://twitter.com/geonews_english/status/1100665010458710016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1100665010458710016&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fscroll.in%2Flatest%2F914747%2Fiaf-air-strikes-sushma-swaraj-meets-chinese-foreign-minister-raises-pulwama-attack)). **Confirmed**: *only* 1 IAF pilot in Pakistan's custody and 1 MiG-21 down.

4. A seemingly unrelated crash of IAF Mi-17 chopper in Budgam in J&K (source: [ANI](https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1100647281391472645)). **Confirmed**: [unrelated](https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1100669321796186112).

&#x200B;

Claims and counter-claims continue. Seek information in this fog of  war.

Edit 1: corrected source links

Edit 2: Not MiG-17 but Mil Mi-17 chopper went down

Edit 3: confirmation with source added for 3 and 4

Edit 4: added more sources

Edit 5: It seems like 2 IAF pilots have been captured, confirmation awaited.

Edit 6: Confirmation from MEA spokesperson added. 1 more jet and 1 pilot from India that Pakistan has claimed to bring down has not been verified by India.

Final edit: Pakistan has only 1 IAF pilot. The second jet Pakistan claimed might as well be the Budgam chopper. Imran Khan low-key had a pretty solid statement. Time for India to clean up the PR, get the pilot back and move on. Oh man, who am I kidding if only it was that easy. Weird part of this current skirmish is that both ruling parties across the border and Pakistan Army benefits from the war personally even though it is not beneficial for citizens of either nation. After three fucking hours and after pak already reports everything they are now confirming this shit. Three hours really? Why is a wing commander flying a MiG-21? Stay safe India, my heart goes out to the loved ones of the pilots.  All of us should go to sleep and say a silent prayer that things don't escalate and things don't spiral out of control when we wake up. Hopefully, things will return to normalcy pretty soon. Godspeed guys! Good night!  Does anyone understand the purpose Modi’s silence on this matter serves?  Looks like the pilot captured is real.

how can IAF claim all pilots accounted for?
 My question is simple. We do not have terrorists camps so attack on our military is an act of aggression.

Does this mean we are one step closer to all out war?! kal se dekh rha hu news, BC kya chutiya reporting karte hai India me news wale. Kal din me times now 300 terrorist killed bata rha tha, rat tak kahi se 41 ho gye. Aaj us pilot k bare me koi kuch nahi bata rha. Why are we still using Mig21 aircrafts? Aren't they old and  notoriously unreliable. Man [this](https://imgur.com/a/Qr3s9ui) is pic of our pilot who is captured. Disheartening. How can we get him back?

And why the fuck these news channels are not regulated when it comes to sensitive reporting. They can at least say no official reports are there yet. 

One claiming 300+ terrorists killed,  other is comparing missiles and nukes. WTF.  I dont want to be hysterical here, but what exactly happens during war, if it breaks out? How will it affect the day to day lives of us normal people?  Looks like they got our guy for real... Here is a video of him in one of the interviews.

""Big - India hands over dossier on #PulwamaAttack to Pak’s acting high commissioner. Diplomacy has begun #BalakotAirStrike""


 Eli5 please, everybody seems to be saying that PM has given full freedom to the armed forces to do as they see fit and all that. He said the same on the day the attack happened. In India however the President is the supreme commander of the armed forces, then how is he not the one saying this and why is there no mention of him whatsoever? Is the PM acting as his spokesperson of sorts? Even if that's the case shouldn't he at least be mentioned in a way like ""he is of the opinion such and such and we all agree with him"" Nothing but twitter hype and fake Alex Jones level news, this is a perfect example of the pernicious sinister nature of social media and fake news. i dont want to be termed as anti national but as current narrative goes it is very negative for us. Media houses running their own versions of story on both sides of countries are real problem for more hatred being spread. Truth being commander abhinandan being captured and 3 videos making rounds in social media of his capture and him sipping tea treated well. Not even one media house has shown it, they are busy thumping chest whole day about shooting down pak f16  [removed] What is going on? Can anyone post the official and verified sources from both the sides. People are reporting unverified things on twitter. This would be appreciated. How is our media reporting guys? I dont watch TV. I am asking how is Republic/Aajtak/Zee/TimesNow ? Are they still fucking biased here/something for the sake of TRP? Or are they being sensible here?

&#x200B; That's it? That's fucking it?  From MEA's press release we now know,

* IAF has only one pilot MIA. Pakistan claims it has two IAF pilots.

* PAF was targeting Indian military infrastructures in response to counter terrorism operations by IAF.

* IAF's MiG-21Bis was shot down not Su-30MKI as claimed by Pakistan.

* IAF shotdown 1 PAF aircraft in a dogfight. Why do we still have the Mig 21? Why has it not been replaced by a new fighter like the SAAB Gripen?

The IAF has been requesting the acquisition of new aircraft to replace the Mig 21 since the 2000s. I can't believe it still hasn't been followed through on.

Failure of both the previous and the current government.  To add on to my last comment, there were lots of people claiming India is becoming too autocratic with the suppression of media but if the media is so fucking stupid and unreliable, what the fuck do you expect?

If it's so easy to disprove you then it will be very easy to suppress you as well.  So apparently the Pakistani F16s entered Indian territory and lured IAF fighters including the MIG 21 that crashed into disputed territory where they were shot down.

If we can prove that they did indeed violate our airspace it would be good.  If anything is true, the sensationalist media is not helping anyone. 

Stay safe, hope everything stabilizes soon [deleted] https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-gives-pakistan-dossier-on-jem-role-in-pulwama-terror-attack/articleshow/68188163.cms And Jaitley goes on record saying ""If USA can kill Osama, why cant we""

&#x200B;

What a joke of a minister! When I thought something sensible will come up from our ministers, these guys just go lower!

&#x200B;

Instead of de-escalating this, these guys are escalating it further. Can we have someone sensible come out and talk to calm some tits?

EDIT-  [Source](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/us-navy-seals-osama-bin-laden-anything-possible-today-arun-jaitley-iaf-airstrike-1466187-2019-02-27) What bothers me the most is, Indian Govt's refusal to share evidence of IAF's attack on Balakot and letting Indian media speculate. Indian Govt could have shared before and after satellite images of the bombed area or flight paths taken by Mirages. 

While Pakistan Govt and PAF retaliated for bombing terrorist camps, and in process captured multiple images and short clips of captured IAF Wing Commander and shared it to the Pakistani media minutes after the incident took place. 

Now, India has been cornered. Captured commander will be paraded and India will be forced to deescalate. yea, republic tv still in denial.  'lies, bunch of lies' they say, totally unironically Abhinandan is the real hero here. 

 > Turkey will stand with Pakistan against India aggression. 

You seriously can't be taking sides at this moment.  JeM's mission is accomplished... No one recognizes this [deleted] I have massive respect for our armed forces, but zero respect for some of the media houses, and specifically Arnab Goswami. He is fanning the fires of unnecessary hatred among people with his style of debating.  Pakistani govt has announced It will release the captured pilot tomorrow. Pakistan spreading old photos

As opposed to already expecting some sort of escalation. Hmm. @ImranKhanPTI will be addressing the nation shortly - Pak PM House

This announcement follows an emergency session of the National Command Authority, the highest security body in Pakistan — the guys who determine if and when to go nuclear.

BREAKING: Confirmed. Pakistan has in its captivity Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, a MiG-21 Bison pilot. Statement from the Indian government shortly. #JustIn | Ministry of External Affairs to brief media at 3:15 pm. ""Pak targetted military installations."" the spokesperson said.  

So...what now?  I might be asking a stupid question, but what harm is there in admitting that Pakistan has custody of our pilot?

(If the claims by Pakistan are true) Indian Pilot in Pakistan is safe and being treated decently: https://twitter.com/salmanmasood/status/1100736311797927937?s=19 Rumors are being spread, polarizing memes are being shared on every platform like crazy. People in this case really need to understand not to believe anything that is said at it's face value.
See news reports from both the countries once to understand how toxic it really is.
 Silver lining of these tragic events: we now know which news stations to avoid like the plague. I suggest a sub section of live updates . It's really confusing to see a list of the same article with a different title. Something like "" Indian aircraft downed by Pakistani forces (date)"" and then underneath that the relevant articles This whole situation throws light on just how disorganized, irresponsible and jingoist Indian news media is. Why the fuck are you bringing in retired old farts who have barely have any first hand knowledge of what is going on right now?

How hard is it to just wait until there are official confirmations from the spokespersons of the armed forces? NDTV seems to gotten their shit together today, not seeing any of the wild claim on social media being reported there.   Pak is winning the PR war that's for sure. https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/pakistan-india-strikes-back-attack-today-iaf-paf-loc-pok-jaitley-indian-air-force-air-strikes-us-osama-bin-laden/373514

> If Navy SEALs can do it, why can’t we: Jaitley lauds IAF air strikes referring to US killing bin Laden in Pak

I hate fuckers like these, giving statement from a public office, in times like this MOST MEDIA CHANNELS DOUBLING DOWN ON THE WAR SENTIMENT.

WE are fucked. Fuck  Kind request to Government of India please issue immediate action over Indian media for playing with the emotions of the less educated people of India and not presenting facts. I hope everyone is listening to Imran Khan's address and understands war will be suicide for both countries.  It seems like Pakistan army is treating Wing Commander Abhinandan with dignity that they would expect had they been captured. Gives hope that he will be reunited with his family some time soon...

- Quint live thread

Shiv Aroor is pro-India commentator and host.  Whether he reports Indian sources or Pakistani sources he is marking them unconfirmed or confirmed based on official statements and evidence. He is also calling out fake news being spread. 

He seems to be quite reliable.

NatSecJeff. He has clear pro-Pakistani bias. But he is retweeting and reporting news from both Indian and Pakistani sources. 

 Confirmed 1 Pilot MIA

Acknowledged by Ind Gov that he is in Pakistan's custody. [removed] After all of this shit is dealt with, a bill should be brought forward to restrict news channels from profiting from all of their coverage of crises like this. The levels that the media has stooped to for views and clicks has caused everybody to act like hypertensive buffoons. Now everybody is embarrassed and unsettled because they're being dealt the same shit by Pakistanis on social media that they themselves were spewing just 24 hour earlier.

1) How genuine do you think is the Pak PM's plea for talks with India?

2) What would it realistically take for us to agree to resume some form of dialogue with Pakistan?

3) Is there any likelihood at all of a re-establishment of diplomatic relations to at least pre 26/11 levels? Where is the RakshaMantri? My folks just shared photos of a Modi alt account tweeting something about Geneva convention on Whatsapp and I do not know how to deal with this anymore. 

&#x200B;

'Tis not a good day.  I haven't checked Twitter all day, but I'm sure Pakistani Arnab Zaid Hamid is living his wet dream today.  This is bad for democracy. 

With all the media attention focused toward the borders, a lot of what's happening within the country are gonna go unchecked. 

Who are creating these memes, photoshopped gory images and videos? IT cells? I'm not from either country, would just like to respectfully say that I feel a lot of fake and hysterical news floating around, nothing major likely to happen and no one stupid enough to use nukes.

Media loves to hype these things, last year when US attacked Syria they made it sound like the Russians were getting ready to engage US airforce and navy (Russians not that stupid), nothing happened.

Nothing will happen here. I feel shame for being part of community where older generations still thinks 120 mill population (including my dad) can wipe out 20 mil population in 5 hours. I don’t see a little hesitation in their voice while saying wipe out 20 mil people. They seems more dangerous than people started WWII. Younger generation (my brother)  believe war is like playing Call of Duty of theirs PS4’s. Thanks to the brainwashing politicians and their propaganda media. 
 Fucking news channels comparing missiles and firepower. Disgusting. So I think. Here is how it really went. Pakistan aircrafts entered India airspace early morning> they tried to do the same manoeuvre like the IAF yesterday> IAF air craft were already there and spotted them> PAF began to flee/go back> IAF somehow decided to 'pursue' them> PAF took advantage of that to outmaneuvere the IAF planes and bring two of them down> PAF captures the pilot> Profit

Somewhere between this moments, IAF might have managed to bring an F16 down. But that's speculation at best. [wtf is this shit :(](https://twitter.com/za_chaudhry/status/1100705256130924546?s=21)

[Pic 2](https://i.imgur.com/U92OUGX.jpg) Man the BJP press conference was a shit show of the highest order!  Fucking hell the Indian side is handling the information disbursement very, very poorly. And OTOH Pakistan is doing it well. Our media is so shit. NDTV seems to have collected themselves and aren't letting war mongering ex-servicement bursting nerves speak for too long. Other channels are just wholeheartedly going for it, letting people say any and everything on their channels. Why can't they stop with their cringy animations and hyperbole. Imran khan's press conference aimed at the idea of avoiding war and cooperation. Meanwhile indian media will probably highlight how imran khan has said that pakistan can decimate india.  Lol zee news just said Pakistani airforce us facing an issue of shortage of fuel and a meeting has been called. The media literally takes the entire country as a laughing stock.  One thing is for sure after this, Indian media is a joke not only here but globally as well. They run their own narrative omitting lot of facts. Always keep your eyes and ears open, they didnt even addres abhinandan issue saying all pilots were safe. Twitter folks had more info than them ? impossible, they are just denying it. No questions taken as well.  Truth is the first casualty of war. It's a bit retarded though that India still uses MiG-21s for air defense/attack. OMFG fuck Zee news to hell.  I feel like the media are also the terrorists here. Meanwhile:

Spread. I'm in Jodhpur, tensions are rising here no kidding. Jets flying over all day (Jodhpur is India's largest Airbase and is close to Pakistan border.) Just so everyone knows: We are not going to war. Seriously. There's no way something like this would be allowed to happen, two nuclear armed countries that have already fought 4 wars. MAD, refers to mutually assured destruction, which is a given in any military conflict involving nuclear weapons. People on both sides realize that even if a conventional war is fought, the country losing might just decide to take the other out, which would mean the other country would respond and tl;Dr everyone dies™. If this escalates further, the United States, Russia, China or UNSC might have to intervene, and make both sides back down. This is a truly f'ed up situation, and we all need to calm down now. Whether we like it or not, in the 21st Century, we can only resolve this through diplomacy.  It didn't even take them half a day to put an board outside my railway station applauding Modi for the bombing and this happens today. This feels like a Curb your enthusiasm meme. But damn this is a serious situation and besides NDTV seems like every fucking news station has lost its mind. It's so obvious they are trying to capitalize on the patriotism just for trps and it's frustrating to watch. It's almost hate speech, inciting people. TOI is showing idiocy at highest level revealing abhinandan's father's name and place of living.

This says that Pak shot down 2 Aircrafts and captured 1 Indian pilot How can there be so much confusion around something so certain. We don't even have any info on what's happening at ground zero. There is no official statement which clarifies things or provides proof. News channels are shouting from yesterday with their so called official sources. On the other hand we have no idea how many of our soldiers are injured/dead because of their stupidity. How do you come up with such a big scale response to eliminate camps within days of such an incursion at pulwana. Was their good planning to back it up or was it just to save face which later became dick measuring contest between both countries top officials. I don't know what to believe. Wtf is happening?? Are we at war? https://mobile.twitter.com/asmashirazi/status/1100667866033147907


YO WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS??? SOMEBODY PLEASE SAY THIS IS FAKE. PLEASE!  No official government statement is biggest issue at the moment. Anyone knows about the second pilot? Is he okay? So apparently they airports that were shut down will start civilian flights again. Hopefully things will de-escalate after the 3:15PM press conference [deleted] LoL so basically Pakistan is right and they dont know what to say? So they put this brief out without admitting anything but admitting at the same time? what the actual fuck? No questions :@ Raveesh Kumar, MEA: One Pakistan Air Force fighter aircraft was shot down by Indian Air Force. In this engagement we have lost one MiG 21. Pilot is lost in action. Pakistan claims he is in their custody. We are ascertaining the facts

https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1100695138819547136 Holy shit what a shit show. So we shot down one of their planes and they deny it. We have one pilot missing in action while they claim they have 2 in their custody.   so, if the pakistani pilot lost his life to abhinandan's mig, will he be tried in pakistan's court now? or is he a PoW? but no war was declared?

edit : no war Wait they said Pak targeted military installation inside our airspace! This seems way too real. Twitter is a weird medium. The trending topic is praising Pakistan and its air force, yet their stock market which would affect the common person more has tanked today.  Now that it's clear that they have one of our pilots what news of the second one? What a shitshow. Our leaders need to stand up and deescalate the situation. Some diplomacy is required. Abhinandan's being interviewed. He says he is being looked after well. Hope there's no coercion.

Pakistan has claimed there are 2 pilots. Any information on the 2nd?  Why is India still deploying these Mig 21 flying coffins vs F16? It makes no sense, we have Mig-29 etc. Maybe we should have waited for those S400s...

Pakistan: We are NOT protecting camps for terrorists!
Jaish E Mohammed: We ANNHILATED 40 Indian Paratroopers thru a suicide bomber, all while sitting in the comfort of our homes in Pak YEAAAA!!  Is the video of Wing Commander Abhinandan being questioned legit? It's being circulated everywhere like crazy. Saw the brave IAF’s wing commander’s video when he was captured by Pak on twitter. He was beaten before their army arrested him.
Seeing the recent development, it seems Pak had  planned this in such a way to lure in Indian aircrafts then shoot them down. They knew we were on high alert and would launch our jets within minutes.
Still I don’t understand why didn’t a complete squadron was used to retaliate. [deleted] imo india today is doing a great job in covering the news. i want to know your opinions  The order to shut down eight airports over the northern states of Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh has been withdrawn.

https://twitter.com/ndtv/status/1100691330865360896 Both indian and Pakistani media are shit. The pakistani media saying how india increased prices of tomato and payed by giving a pilot and Pakistani gave surprise to India while we have indian media saying 300 terrorists were killed and whole pakistan will go hereafter.  Why was the Air Marshal even there if he wasn't going to say anything?? Well that was quick. So one pilot definitely is a prisoner in Pakistan right now. MEA confirms that they lost one MiG 21 to Pakistan. It states the pilot is missing in action. They claim that a MiG 21 downed a PAF ~~F-16~~.

 EDIT: No mention in the statement on the type of aircraft downed.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN7aOlbS7ck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN7aOlbS7ck)  


Pakistan has rejected the dossier we gave to them for JeM. What the hell did you expect ? And the sorry bit is, people from my own state who should have had the wisdom after serving in the civil services end up saying that Imran Khan should get a Nobel peace prize.....what the hell ?  Do you guys still not understand how Pakistan operates ? 

Bots / trolls / people blaming the system / bhakts / liberals / Pakistani / Indian sloganeering will not be tolerated. I shall personally report them if that is the case.

Please note that this is not an accusatory question, rather a solemn one. I am an apolitical person who cares about this nation's interest like any other Indian. After I accidentally ""doxxed"" myself here, I got several negative messages from both ""bhakts"" and ""liberals"" alike. I was labeled many names because I am a Kashmiri, but I do not care about it. What I care about is the nation, which presses me to ask this question today. Even in a time of near-war, we succumbed to trolls, memes, fake news, disinformation, misinformation, you name it, instead of relying on official sources from our government. A section of our media still lauded Imran Khan for the so-called ""peace gesture"" of releasing the pilot, even though it is in accordance with the Geneva convention. Even the commando brigade of journalists in the country thought that Pak has buckled. These jokers just made war a joke. A Kashmiri politican says that ""Imran Khan has acted like a statesman"". Are you serious ?!?

Then there is a politician who says the strikes will give him and his party 22 votes in a state. There is political bickering over the fact that a PM did not call an all-party meet and instead was tending to the matter at hand. Did George W. Bush call an all party meet right after 9/11 ? Even he took 4 days before a joint session of Congress was called. But, there is political bickering over it.

In the war for truth over social media, many forgot that :

* India's strike was not targeting military / civilian installations, only terrorist camps.
* Pakistan crossed Indian airspace in retaliation to ensure the country does not implode due to Jihadi backlash and to save face, with a clear intent to target Indian Army installations ; thus, the escalation was from the Pakistani side.
* The control of the escalation ladder despite the capture of our pilot stood with India - India decided not to escalate and instead pursued strong diplomatic ties to ensure that the airman is returned unconditionally.
* Pakistan executes a terrorist attack before our elections, claims they were Kashmiris, says it has no terrorists attacking India on it's soil, asks for evidence, hoping for a status quo in relationships later on until it can repeat cowardly acts like this.
* All the while, Pakistan follows a good disinformation campaign of lies and denials until the truth finally comes out.
* When the Wg Cmd from the Pakistan's side passed away as a result of his injuries after the dogfight, Pakistan did not even acknowledge his passing - this is the same country which denied there were army regulars in Kargil. It likes to live in a world of its own lies, deceit and conceit, and there are Punjab politicians who want to talk to them.

Then there is yesterday's press conference where the top brass was clearly embarrassed at hearing questions from 3rd grade journalists like ""aapka pilot aa raha hai, aapko kaisa lag raha hai, Imran Khan ne shaanti ka prastaav rakha hai""....

Are we really Indians worth fighting for ? If not, I request Redditors to spread the word of serving the nation in whatever capacity first. Thank you. Indians who are truly not awakened, please realise that each of us play a very crucial role of keeping the morale of the armed forces up, irrespective of caste, creed, political leaning, religion, state etc. Please do not fall into the trap of fake news and Pakistan's deception tactics in every sphere they operate in, whether PR, military, diplomatic, or journalistic. Hello to all the people who are going to scroll past this bs AGAIN just for fun This is turning out to be a PR disaster for India One of the biggest reason for war would be fake news. Why is it that it’s only Indian media that’s claiming they shot down 1 PAF? It seems all the international media is only writing about the 2 IAF jets shot down and the Indian pilot being captured. 

I seriously hope the situation de-escalates, this is not looking good [removed] Interesting to see how wng cmdr Abhinandan handled the questioning. Refused to identify anything compromising, even on video. If he was being coerced, he would have just said that he is being treated well. But he is saying that he can't identify information clearly.

 Vishnu Som from NDTV reports:

> The fog of war. Contrary to reports thus far, all IAF pilots accounted for say some sources to me.  A Pak F-16 has been lost on their side. Was it a case of friendly fire ? What happened to those pilots?

> Am hearing Pakistanis have shot down their own F-16. No Indian jet shot, no pilot captured.


My hunch is these psyops will continue for next few days, till their army is able to clean the Balakot site. 

Also please beware, many old images of Indian planes shot down is circulating in the Pak media and social media. FAKE NEWS: Pakistani Twitter handle with 500k+ followers peddles video of Feb 19 Surya Kiran crash survivor Vijay Shelke in Bangalore, saying it is captured IAF pilot.

https://twitter.com/ShivAroor/status/1100660234090151937 Does the prime minister not have 5 minutes for an official statement during a crisis?  May the people of both countries have a safe night and wake up to some sense of sanity.  The next 12-24 hours are critical.   Lets send Arnab Goswami and Zahid Hamid on the border with AK-47.  Let them decide who wins it. After all those two want it more than anyone

Let the soliders stay at home Am I alone in thinking that Modi's foolhardiness has boxed us into a corner? Idiot can't deescalate now coz he will lose the fanatic base that pushed for this in the first place and I shudder to think what escalation will lead to. I don't see us coming out of this looking good... :( Abhinandan is fast emerging as a hero in my eyes. After taking a beating from the locals he stands up tall with his hands behind his back and says ""I'm sorry sir, that's all I'm allowed to tell you."" and even goes on to ask for information and asks his captors who they are. He flummoxed his captors with his reliance on procedure. He had to do it twice when they didn't heed his first refusal. I spent the day reading on Reddit and watching news where all I got to know was that Indian media were stuffing their own opinions and ignoring actual news. Spreading hate against Pakistan and making this matter deviate from the actual point. 

We were to fight the terrorists right? Then why all I see is people celebrating and belittling the opposite countries and making people more agitated, turning this into another Indo Pak feud which was originally an attack towards terrorism. 

I don't know if many young Indians know the adversities and traumatic impact war has on people and society. I know people posting online and saying agitative things filled with hatred and pointless accusations which just make things more complex and promote more hate.

If you watch news just check the news well and get your facts right. There's no way Indian media is showing the entire truth. Don't go out saying hateful stuff after watching NDTV.

Please report anyone who's promoting war or hateful comments that might agitate someone. 

**The youth needs to understand that it's not India VS Pakistan, it's India Vs terrorism and supporting a nuclear war with Pakistan will just bring ruin to the country and if you don't know how actual war looks like please search it online and enlighten yourself**

God I'm praying for no war. Don't let any human die because of this. 


 Pakistanis on Twitter using old crashes of MIG-27 and Hawk 132 to say they have shot down IAF jets.

Before sharing pictures on WhatsApp, please verify if the planes have actually been shot down

Pathetic. Guys, any confirmation regarding the surgical strike IAF took on, where they're claiming that over 300 terrorists were killed? It worrying how much propaganda we hear and not a lot of real news in our mainstream media.  I had  recently commented on someone accusing the Pakistani army of ill-treating their prisoner of war. 

Another video has surfaced which points to the contrary:

I'll just copy paste my older comment here as well:

> It (his leaked video) gave me goosebumps. But he stood tall, attentive. Answered with dignity. You could see there was fear and terror, yet he maintained courage. What a brave soldier! 

> A small opposing perspective to what you said, though. Forgive me if this is the wrong time. 

> I think, based on what we've seen till now, he has been treated better than I would have ever expected. 

> The locals wanted to bash his head in with rocks and boulders. And the Pakistani army didn't let that happen (fired warning shots).

> He was hurt and hit, but as far as we can tell, not tortured. 

> By the looks of it, they are treating him with dignity as well -- as most prisoners of war should be treated. 

> Of course, he was bleeding. And he could have been treated better. But the cynic in me expected way worse. 

> Seeing him and how he is treated by the opposing army gives me more hope than pessimism.  (edit: maybe, if the situations were reversed, I fear more mistakes could have been made from our side. I would still like to optimistically believe we would do the right thing -- just as Pakistan is doing now.)

> And I don't want to use this word, but I will -- he is now a ""tool"" in the diplomatic de-escalation process. 

> I hope he (and if there are others) return home soon. 

> This nightmare has got to end. 

---

The way he is being treated (for whatever cynical reasons our minds can conjure), it gives me hope for a slightly less bleak future. 

---

> ""The tea is fantastic."" This whole situation with the media, government, terrorists and Pakistan is making me very angry, and I hate myself for that because this is exactly what all of them want.

The terrorists, Government and media all want you to be afraid and angry because it benefits them. This is what they want.  Any news from PM yet? Republic is reporting that he gave a free hand to the army to respond any way they see fit. This means war right? I'm scared right now wtf? Guys, stop posting links to Twitter, especially to tweet by Pakistani journos. Twitter is not a news source and it's unreliable af.  **NSFW**- [**This is from a verified Twitter account**](https://twitter.com/AnsarAAbbasi/status/1100647597302300672) but can anyone please confirm it? Pakistan DG-ISPR Live-[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDPdysI88Co](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDPdysI88Co) [removed] I don't think Pakistan can afford to fight us. Engaging in war will lead to an economic crisis situation in their country. Their message of wanting ""peace"" now is a measured one.  Apparently video of the captured Indian pilot. Seems believable at first glance.

AT LEAST NAME THE PILOT!  Per Pak media, the guy's name is Abhinandan, his video is in Twitter, disturbing. Someone eli5? Who shooting who? So confusing  Imran Khan claims two Indian jets were shot down. That means there could be another pilot.

What's the situation on this?
 this is all really so confusing. Is there any neutral news source for all this info that we can actually trust ? Good day to learn about [our borders](http://www.indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Kashmir-Map.jpg) Now what, we wait? I'm still a bit unclear on the sequence of events. Did the 2 jets of ours that got shot down, were they in Indian territory or Pakistani territory or Disputed Territory when they got hit?

And when did the PAF F16 get shot? Before or after and where?

Please dont speculate. https://twitter.com/exdigger59/status/1100732043762126848?s=21 Wing Commander Abhinandan’s latest video >Condemn Pulwama Attack, National Security Must Transcend Political Considerations: Opposition Joint Statement

>The Opposition, in a joint statement, said that they urged government to take the nation into confidence on all measures to protect India's sovereignty, unity and integrity.


 When the rivals allow each other to reassure their domestic audiences, the chances of conflict go down. Now, facts have intruded. 

https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-02-27/india-and-pakistan-have-lost-chance-to-de-escalate-in-kashmir Not a part of any side. Just wish to give my sympathy.
Hope it blows over and you'll all be alright  Pakistan has confirmed that only one pilot is in their custody. 

Can someone tell me who was in the video that was circulating on Twitter showing his charred remains? Was that an indian pilot?  Neither Pakistan or India have said anything about another pilot's death.  I know I’m on the India sub, but where do you guys/gals suggest I should do my research to catch up on the history between India and Pakistan in an unbiased way?

I admittedly know far less about the conflicts that have occurred than I should and feel like I really need to catch up. 

Feel dumb not being up to date on a major world conflict, one that results in casualties.  [deleted] https://youtu.be/xcfUOLYX5pU

Captured Indian pilot speaks out What news outlet can I watch in the US that is covering this?  I’d like to hear updates, but every news outlet I’ve looked at is just covering the Cohen thing that I am not interested in watching and nothing else Not to be critical, is there a list of abbreviations?

Some I figured out myself, but some are a mystery to me.   Goodbye folks. I'll filter the comments into controversional. Wish me luck. Anyone checking flightradar know what these are?

Unidentified jets with no destination. I've seen two fly out of Lahore over the past few hours and I think they disappear after a bit. PAF ops? Just some things to keep in mind about these two countries:
The majority of Kashmiris want independence, however both India and Pakistan won't allow it. India needs full control of Kashmir to gain access into central Asia, a border with Afghanistan, and to diminish Chinese-Pakistan relations. Pakistan needs control of Kashmir to deny India those options and to strengthen their foreign policy options. Part of China's OBOR initiative is to gain access to Pakistan's Gwadar port because it will allow China to bypass the Strait of Malacca. Also, keep in mind that both Pakistan and India have increasing populations. The Himalayan Tibet is pretty much both Pakistan's and India's water tower. Control over that water supply is essential.
 BJP Facebook troll farms already on full damage control...

None mentions the pilot. But apparently MIA means he may be have been killed,captured,deserted .Instead they could once in a while accept that is captured by them and assured us that measures will be taken accordingly for his release immediately.Now i feel sad for our pilot being held there for how long. Imran khan press conference :
 He said that wars always have disastrous effects and he is still ready to cooperate with india to bring down terrorist groups and says he doesn't want the land of Pakistan to be used for terrorism's purpose.  Any defence experts here? There are a lot of opinions floating around in this forum and it's leading to nowhere. Most of the comments are from guys like me, who get our dose of information from news channels/ twitter. We probably have no idea about how these things escalate, and what happens if it does. 

Is there anyone out there who is qualified enough to comment and can give an unbiased account of the real possibilities and what happens then? And what should be the course of actions for both nations? [deleted] A dossier was handed over to Pakistan side with specific details of JeM complicity in Pulwama terror attack and the presence of JeM terror camps and its leadership in Pakistan.It was conveyed that India expects Pakistan to take immediate and verifiable action against terrorism emanating from territories under its control: MEA

SOURCE : https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/1100749246993711105 Make no mistake, if this escalates it’s going to be because of fake news. Not in the conservative nonsense buzzword, but in the actual sense of the phrase. Is it true that things are setting down guys? I see lesser updates in the thread. My parents where flying from Thailand when this all happened. Here is an image of their flight route. https://i.imgur.com/SrtxMOM.jpg So basically, we are back at square one. Until the next terrorist attack I guess... Pakistan claims to shoot down a jet and arrest the pilot and India claims to shoot down a jet and the pilot escaped. And 2 jets crashed in Kashmir. Who to trust? Hmmmm Is anyone here willing to accept that yesterday's strike were a blunder by modi government? IndiaTV still with the Pakistan blaming only, no mention of the pilot yet. 10/10 journalism  Non-Indian here.

Why is nobody talking about the fact that the Islamic terrorist group (Jaish-e-Mohammad) that started this whole mess and led to 40 deaths on Indian soil is funded and protected by Pakistan?

It doesn’t make any sense ... how can Pakistan honestly say they are against terrorism and then shoot down two Indian fighter jets that are going after terrorists. They should be helping the Indian military target and destroy these groups ...

Somebody needs to catch Pakistan on this bullshit. Pakistani here. Let me tell you, we dont want a war. Many inncocents will die. And those who are om twitter saying lets start war are you guys ok? Seriosly, its not a small issue. Not everything is a movie.

""We are ready to sacrifice"" really? Sacrifice what? Nothing will remain in the end. both have atomic bombs etc and you we share borders! Just think about that one child who is struggling hard to get grades. Imagine him being blown up or the one who is playing or just came into the world. Seriously, what is wrong with you? The one who is not even born. 

As for respected AbhiAnand, I hope the pakistani Govt returns him, he has a family and is treated with kindness the way our religion teaches us. The other pilot is in the hospital for treatement as per news Here's how the timeline looks from an Indian perspective

* Pakistan backed JeM kill 44 CRPF soldiders.
* We retaliate with air strikes (a week later), and claim to have bombed a JeM facility resulting in significant casualties for JeM. 
* Within 24 hours, Pakistan retaliates. They target military installations (according to us), and have now even captured one IAF pilot. The video of him being attacked by Pakistani civilians is both sad and humiliating. 

At this stage, they hold all the cards. They can release the pilot as a gesture of goodwill. We will have no option but to accept if we don't want to go to war. And a war will be disastrous, so I hope that we are really not considering it as an option. 

The current Indian government has completely mishandled the situation and it seems we seriously underestimated Pakistan's capability to strike back. Now we've ended up giving Pakistan (and Imran Khan) an excellent opportunity to broker peace and garner major international claim. We didn't achieve anything and we've ended up with our egg on our faces. Fake wars manufacturing fake consent. Always remember the events that brought this about. Pakistan receiving 21 billion dollars and a corrupt army trying to justify their existence. So the bombing happens right on time. Modi trying to justify his failures and reelections so following attacks happens. No side is innocent and both sides win. The only side that loses are the people of both nations. See increased state control on speech to defend the ""integrity"" of the motherland from both sides happen now. 

&#x200B;

This isn't a war of nations against each other. This is a war of corrupt money and blood sucking bureaucracy on it's own people. Question is will both of our nations see or will we follow that state preached propaganda. [removed] [Breaking](https://twitter.com/ReutersIndia/status/1100653478479835136?s=19): Taliban says India, Pakistan clashes will affect Afghan peace process.

We really have come down to this.  War mongerers WhatsApp groups are silent. Once it deescalates they will again start sending shit forwards.  I'm in Mumbai, on fucking Marine Drive, eating bhelpuri and commenting on the India v Pak situation. 

FML.  Meanwhile, Narendra ji is scheduled to address more than a crore BJP karyakartas (as claimed) tomorrow via one of the biggest video conference till date. ""[I'm sorry. I'm not supposed to tell you this.](https://twitter.com/MalihaMansoori/status/1100732036174688256)""

The balls on this guy. After all their official claims and fake images, their credibility comes down to producing that 1 IAF pilot they claim to have arrested.

I'm pretty sure that was just another bluff. So, even the word of the Official Pakistani Army rep cannot be trusted, mind you. If the video of the captured pilot is true then why the hell did we go back there? Was there a dogfight and we had to defend? I'd be pissed at the airforce and PM if we tried our luck again after yesterday.",[R]eddiquette

Apparently there was a garbage strike there so the trash and filth was just piling up.

Where once you're caught, you join a big chain and chase people! :P i really despise the guy, but i will give credit where credit is due. trump has really nailed the ""dancing baby"" pose. I think it's difficult for Trump because of his own height also because he has....small hands ^^/s  ^^^(/s ^^^is ^^^just ^^^so ^^^that ^^^I ^^^don't ^^^get ^^^downvoted, ^^^I ^^^really ^^^meant ^^^what ^^^I ^^^said ^^^:D) This has reached r/all. Get ready to be hit with impact of buttloads of idiots and butthurt trump supporters.  He feels it in his trumpbones No he just has small hands. Trump looks like he's just been splashed with holy water.  Modiji ka side fatty pose dikhao zara :) It's to get around his gut. Has to send his hips back and haunch over. Not only lack of flexibility, he's just fat. Crores on yoga day paid off well :D that smile is creepy Trump's face looks like he's constipated. I started dating a beautiful New Delhite for the past year and she's been telling me all about Modi, and he seems like a really cool leader. Not only his political actions but the man himself. Makes me sad as an American I have the other guy as our leader... Burn This is how you grab a p.... Fat fuck If I recall correctly, Modi wasn't wearing this suit at all. Why does trump look so much like Austin Powers dancing? Superb! Am I the only boring girl who does yoga in my room.

 Trump does yoga though. I've witnessed him doing Downward-Spiralling Dog on multiple occasions *Fat guy in a little coooat* [deleted] Obese and not obese. To be fair one of those two men isn't even human, current best theory is he's some conglomeration of rotten oranges, self Tanner, and rancid fecal matter. Adverse way of self promotions. Do you even stretch Bro?  That suit looks so big yet so small Thanks @op for posting this !!!! I need my daily dose of modi memes !! 👍 Haha Wouldn't trump's suit make it difficult to cross his arms like that? He's also rather fat It’s a bit more than yoga I️ think.. Any further and his suit will have a nice big tear in the back Trump looks so uncomfortable... probably because of all the pussy grabbing he's been up to. Silly Drumpf Modi ji should have held hands while being upside-down. Trump is just doing his best Beyoncé-face Wut is this even  Yoga is a good way for us to exercise. It can helps us to make our body  soft and smart. Firstly, he's an idiot.

Secondly, I have little doubt that if I was suddenly thrust into a scenario like that, I would probably be awkward about it as well, since if you've never done it, sure. Any other world leader new to it would be briefed about it, It's a traditional ending, they'll do *this*. But nope, this dope doesn't have the attention span or interest in listening. Classically he mentioned he's not been able to *watch TV* about the growing Moore controversy, because the only input this jackass will listen to is Fox and Friends. Say what you want but Mudikaka oozes charisma  I get this is a joke, trump is 188 cm in height while people besides him look 150-160 cm in height... Anyone would have trouble doing that Hahaha yoga is good for health What they won't tell you is that the two holding the hands of the leader of the free world are trying to rip his arms off. Hahaha.. LOL :D Image copied, memes generating Um it's obviously awkward when both people beside you are half your height.  In this thread: short people who never have to uncomfortably bend down to touch others. It was not about no yoga and yoga. It is about Junk food vs Organic one #gogreen #lol Have you ever tried that in a suit? Shit sucks He probably has a lot of fun ruining our economy.. Doing yoga would not make that any easier for someone as fat as he is. Wow, holy shit, apparently I missed another huge scandal lol. 

Browsing /r/all and seeing this, I'm impressed how many of you at skeptical of American media and rightfully so! 

This one is loads worse than u thought. 


I did a Google search to find more pictures of this event to see if he was making that face a lot or if it could be a joke or momentary something 


I found... Not a single photo which wasn't taken at this moment. On Google. The search returned some badly times photos like this and then random other photos. Ok. 

So I searched for a video of the handshake. The ONLY results Google returned to me were edited clips that ONLY showed the awkward part. 


So I had to find a video of the whole ceremony and find this part... 


https://youtu.be/3GtSorFUQhc @ 56:40

You can see that he fucks up the hand positioning for about 3 seconds or so, then realized and fixed it, and it looks to me like he's making the face as a joke. 

But all Google would show me is unflattering stills and edited videos and about 20 articles about how Trump fucked it up soooooooooooooo bad. 


Like the first feeding lie I fucking hate how our media just thinks it can get away with absolute bullshit fabrications. And the problem is... They can get away with it. Because Google will cooperate and bury the truth. Fuck Google fuck the media  Also, maybe just a looser clothes vs a tighter suit. Dunno but it seems plausible considering how restricting suits are. Great now those douchebags are going to brigade and start shit President Trump is 6 foot 4. Sarwagun Sampan. xD Bhakts got goosebumps.  **Yoga and EXCESS YOGA**

**EXCESS** of anything is bad. Here is an example- you can start making such facial expressions. Well part of that is the odd angle of standing with short men More like tall and short.  I think it's because Mr trump is much taller than the people on his left and right. Lol. As if Feku does Yoga It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that Trump is like a foot taller that the people beside him.  Guess he couldn’t hold their hands like a bitch. [removed] Posting this in the India sub is very offensive in my opinion.

American ""yoga"" which is a mocking commercialized stolen portion of Indian religious practice into a money making exercise fad IS NOT REAL YOGA.

So saying the Indian man is ""flexible"" due to ""yoga"" is obviously referencing the American kind. 

ASANAS ARE A TINY AND NON ESSTNTIAL PART OF YOGA.

Proper raja yoga which uses asanas is done in ONE asana and the spiritual part is done purely in the mind through meditation.

American ""yoga"" is literally stealing a religious practice, bastardizing it, misunderstanding it and selling mats and lessons at studios.

DONT SUPPORT IT. 

If you want to be all ""oriental and like spiritual dude"" LEARN THE ACTUAL PRACTICE. It's NOT just for asians or Indians. But do NOT just mock it.  [deleted] /r/pics",Politics
"Help, ideas needed. HLL poisoned my village with mercury. There have been 250 cancer deaths in just 5 years in just my tiny village. Se[r]ious replies only. I don't want to leave this be, and need some help on which NGO's might be interested in fighting this case.

**Background Reading**

* [Kodaikanal mercury poisoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodaikanal_mercury_poisoning)
* [Unilever's Mercury Fever](http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=624)

The summary of these articles would be as follows,

A company called Ponds moved its thermometer factory from the US to Kodaikanal in 1982.

HLL took over Ponds, ran operations till 2001.

A shitton of Mercury was found onsite and Greenpeace and other NGO's have been on the case.

What has been ignored because of lack of visibility is the plight of my village (which I will not name). My village sits right on the Kodai foothills and till the year 2000, our only source of water was a river that ran through the village. The river ran very close to the Ponds factory.

I have since 2001 been seeing an exponential death rate due to cancer. I myself lost my Grandmom to cancer in 2004, my tiny village of around 5,000 people has seen about 250 cancer deaths in just the past 5 years. That is a 5% mortality rate just from cancer. India has by comparision a 0.05% mortality rate. In other words my village has a 8500% greater mortality rate from cancer as compared the nation at large. 

If you factor in other variables like lifestyle caused cancer like Lung cancer because of smoking, and the fact that the vast majority of the 250 dead had none of these (or exposure to pollution for that matter) habits the numbers would look worse.

I want to bring this to the attention of somebody. I am not even looking at a case or a payout or anything, but just to bring this to some form of limelight. Do I just spam media outlets with an email, or should I contact GP / other NGO's...ideas are welcome.

Further studies in case you are interested.

[Studies and Reports on environmental pollution and public health hazard caused by Hindustan Lever in Kodaikanal](http://www.sipcotcuddalore.com/Kodaikanal/studies.htm). 

[Berijam lake](http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Blog/Guest-blog/hanging-in-the-mist-mercury-contamination-in-/blog/47184/).

>>Moss samples collected from trees surrounding the Berijam Lake, located 20 km from the factory, were also tested. Mercury levels were in the range of 0.2 µg/kg, while in Kodaikanal Lake the lichen and moss levels were 7.9 µg/kg and 8.3 µg/kg, respectively. Fish samples from the Kodaikanal Lake also showed mercury levels in the range of 120 to 290 mg/kg.

>>The fish in Kodaikanal Lake are contaminated, and this has caused the loss of livelihood for many people. Water as far as Madurai, a major city about 130kms from Kodaikanal, has been contaminated. That's no surprise because the contaminated water from the mountains was bound to flow onto the plains below.

This article talks about a town 130 Km's away and one that has no direct linkage to it via any river. My village is 20 kms from Berijam (about 50 km's by road), and the river in question, the [Varaha](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/varaha-river-to-flow-unimpeded/article2661510.ece) originated in Berijam. We are upstream, one of the first major settlements on the river, so the pollution and sewage that eventually killed the river really didn't matter to us. 

Edit - Throwaway for obvious reasons. Don't want this post to be sidetracked by petty partisanship.

edit 2 - Guys, have received PM's from Timesnow. Livemint has contacted the mods, and the mods have provided me a contact id. I have also been contacted (via) PM of an international NGO that looks into such cases.

To be honest I never expected this kind of traction and it is kind of scary now, but I am going to go ahead and email these three entities whatever info it is they require as well as put them onto people in my village.

edit 3 : 6th June 2015, 1300 IST - Guys,  I have initiated contact with 3 Indian Media outlets (big names) who reached out to me. I am now going to go by what they recommend next.

I will keep this thread updated as and when there is a d4evelopment. I have also been approached by 3 reddit users who kindly offered me their labs to test if I need so, but right now, I only have sketchy data to go by (as others here have pointed). I am going to co-operate with the media names and first see if something comes up via their more extensive due diligence.

Thank you. Just to reassure you (that I am not misusing the goodwill of the forum) the issue is real, maybe the cause is not mercury directly, but something is poisoning my village and my post was and remains well intentioned and not a ""troll post"" as a few have alleged via PM. Tweet to our [Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change](https://twitter.com/moefcc) & [Shri Prakash Javadekar](https://twitter.com/PrakashJavdekar) .

Ask mods. They might help.

 Do you have a test report of water sample testing for high mercury? If not, please collect some samples and get it tested. You can get some NGO to sponsor that if you cannot afford it.

Please compile some research papers/studies on the correlation between high mercury content and cancer.

Prepare one dossier with sample testing report and your research. Send it to government. Recruit NGOs to fight your cause based on these solid facts. Publish it on a blog post, link it from reddit and twitter etc. My 2 paise. Mercury is a dangeorus poison which can have serious harmful effects, but it is not confirmed as possible cause of cancer. 

As per EPA mercury is not known to cause cancer, but we don't know that for sure. 

http://www.epa.gov/mercury/effects.htm  - Mercury doesn't really cause cancer.
- Cancer isn't a single disease. What cancers are we talking about specifically?
- Problem might not be the mercury at all, but some other pollutant.
- 250 Cancer deaths isn't necessarily a lot. What's the age of the population? On average, every fifth person (about 20%) will get some form of cancer (in western Europe). In India the number is probably a lot lower due to infant mortality and high mortality rates due to treatable conditions (infectious diseases / trauma), so a high cancer morbidity/mortality in your village could, for example, correlate with a high average age and paradoxically a particularly safe area to live...

Source: I'm a radio-oncologist. 1. Send this reddit link to Prakash Javadekar, PM Modi and the Min of Environment & Forestry (already been mentioned by another redditor here)

2. Additionally, also send this to Vox Media, BBC, NYT & The Guardian. These people are more serious than the Indian media which can be bought off by big Corporate money (not joking!) 

The Guardian is the most serious of all. They are known for their investigative journalism. 

Good luck!! A little more details and this story can be transferred to a webpage/blog-post. This would then allow everyone to link back to that webpage. Gives easier visibility get in touch with Chemists Without Borders and Engineers Without Borders. Both are working on arsenic testing and filtering in Bangladesh, a lot of the tech should be applicable to other heavy metals. It is about time we show this companies that India will not tolerate this kind of negligible behaviour towards health of the anyone. This needs to be on Front Page.

PS: why don't you name your village? this will help get it into the media quick. All you media lurkers here please pick this up. 

Try making a blog post and possibly a video that can go viral.. This needs a lot of visibility. 

Once there is a bit of traction, email /tweet to HUL guys..  
Hey /u/UnileverCancerFactor,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topredditposts with all the other top posts. guys i got a reply from the senior editor of india today

Gayatri Jayaraman ‏@Gayatri__J  3m3 minutes ago
Gayatri Jayaraman retweeted maria prem
yes my hometown is Kodai. My father has been helping the villagers. you could speak to him if you want.  



edit: it appears that there is a legal case going on against HUL in the high court , with some high profile lawyers fighting against HUL , so thats that

 Punjab and pesticides - same story. Contact media, keep sending pings by people over there to them till you hear back, it only works if they think it's catastrophic or popular.  I highly doubt it is Mercury that is contributing to these higher rates of cancer. In isolated population enclaves, such as your village, it is not uncommon for cancer mortality rates to spike to 5,10, even 15% in some periods. This is simply due to genetic predisposition to cancer. Don't know how closely they look at genetic markers in India, but it maybe useful to look at the genetic background of all those people that have been dying of cancer to see if there is a commonality, which is what my guess would be.  This wont lead to any action unless picked up by Western media. We need to get this seen by someone in NYT or HP. Unilever would hate Western media questioning them. From my side, I will try and connect you to my personal media connects.  The only people fighting the good fight in cases like these are the people affected or concerned citizena like OP, who dont have a loud enough voice, or NGOs who are hated on this sub. We have to give this the voice it deserves. In addition to all the media also share this to the logical indian page on fb. They do a good job highlighting such topics. Media reporting this is only gonna get shot down by this sub calling them presstitutes or something, and western media called trying to malign india's growth story.  There's not much of a link between mercury and cancer. I'd stay away from those fish, though, as the current levels are definitely high enough to cause neurotoxicity and to be a serious teratogen (Google Minimata disease). For the love of god, tell pregnant women in particular not to eat those fish. >The fifth in our series of articles on Global Compact companies examines Unilever's response when caught dumping toxic mercury waste from a thermometer factory in Southern India earlier this year. The Anglo-Dutch company recently closed the factory. Community members, however, allege that the multinational has downplayed the dangers of mercury and misled the public in an attempt to cover up the truth. Indian journalist Nityanand Jayaraman reports for CorpWatch.

I'm not shocked.

I'm Dutch, I know what kind of people end up working at high positions in Unilever. They're narcissistic rich kids who studied in Leiden, go to the same fraternity and make sure to hand each other nice jobs after graduation.

We in the first world own the world's giant corporations and export the dirty jobs that render the local environment uninhabitable to the third world.

I kind of feel like opening linkedin and sending some of these guys some links to this post to see what their company does. Mercury as such is not known to cause cancer - compounds like mercuric chloride are possible carcinogens though. Check if these reports are testing for elemental mercury or for mercuric chloride as well. Crosspost this to /r/worldnews as well. You never know, it might catch on. I mailed this story - linking this Reddit post - to Gawker media.  >A shitton of Mercury was found onsite and Greenpeace and other NGO's have been on the case.

Keep this in mind the next time you people say NGOs are against davalapment in the nation. This is some Erin Brokovich level shit man. Spreading this through my network! MNCs should not get away with these things. I remember Padmini swaminathan talk about this issue and about how she was looking at the number of people who were afflicted by cancer and how many of them were women and and widows who had taken on the jobs after the men in the family succumbed to Cancer.

Major Edit : You could get in touch with Medico Friend Circle too, they are a bunch of medicos who had in the past dealt with Bhopal survivors too.  When I saw this post first time, I was quiet sure that this will get ignored in our usual randia drama. 

But now I feel like this sub has some potential. Head of TOI is a close family member. I will send this to him.  Look the only way to help your village is to draw a direct line between cancer caused to HLL operation. These will be production methods and waste disposal. You will need to get a group of people that can help collect, categorize and test samples collected.  This will take time so be ready for a long fight. After you have conclusive proof of these data you have collected and it points to HLL then proceed . it may also be possible your data may point to a completely different source of these cancer. 

So, first get your data. Secondly establish the correct link between the source and effect. Thirdly don't make accusation over social media without doing the first two steps. You can open your self to legal litigation for a organization that can afford to tie you up in the court system before you even start. So, best of luck.  > my tiny village of around 5,000 people has seen about 250 cancer deaths in just the past 5 years. That is a 5% mortality rate just from cancer. India has by comparision a 0.05% mortality rate. In other words my village has a 8500% greater mortality rate from cancer as compared the nation at large. 

I don't understand your numbers. 250 over 5 years would be 50 deaths per year for 5000 people or 1% per year. And you're saying 5% (over 5 years) is 8500% greater than 0.05%.

In any case, I don't think that the Indian death rate for cancer could be as low as 0.05% unless the people were normally dying young from other diseases. Since cancer isn't easily curable, if large amounts of the population live into old age, 1/3 of them are going to die of cancer, which would give a much higher number than 0.05% per year. have tweeted and retweeted , get the word out Palani, i know the little town at the foothills. I've lived there too. Good bless the people. Can I ask if the mercury is in the form of methyl mercury? If that is the case, there is a way to estimate concentrations very accurately if needed.

This paper talks about the method:
http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac500517h
 Harmful substances to developing a cancer is cadmium, lead, radioactive waste. Mercury I do not think a direct causative agent of cancer. Famous in mercury poisoning is Minamata disease in Japan, it is a disease that affects the human nervous.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihFkyPv1jtU Nearly 5000 upvotes ?? While super terrible, mercury doesn't cause cancer. Moreover, dying of cancer is associated with not dying of other causes..so you need to identify unusual and early presentation of cancer. In the US, cancer is the second most common cause of death (about 30%), basically because people live longer these days. Mercury poisoning is (was?) a big issue in Canada too

Here is a news item on same
http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/two-ontario-first-nations-still-plagued-by-mercury-poisoning-report/article4230507/

Here is a research paper on same

https://www.mcgill.ca/msr/msr-volume-4/mercury-poisoning-grassy-narrows 5% is super low rate of cancer-especially if they are over 50. If anything, it would seem to prevent cancer. You need to check your numbers.  Mods could you share this on twitter ?

Preferably after verification of the facts (via PM maybe?) 5% cancer mortality rate seems extremely low. Could it be that people in your village live longer on average than the average Indian? That could make them more likely to die of cancer in old/older age instead of viruses and such. Men have a 45% cancer rate in the West probably because we live longer. It could also be a random effect or genetic dispossessions in a huge village family. I would strongly recommend you test the water and then write all the names of the dead down. And also their family lines and where they lived. Right now we can't say for certain what causes it. And suing the company responsible for it requires better proof. We can't rule out a second source of pollution either without more tests of the water and the ground. Please try contacting MC mehta or Center for public interest litigation

Its not as easy as that, but you've got to do something. Well done on taking up the issue, let's back this up!

I'm just gonna tweet outthis thing coz I'm a nobody., How about the hashtag #PoisoningPonds? Are they shadowbanned? I can't visit their user profile.  This is incredible response from r/india.., i hope your issue gets resolved ASAP., gets traction from all the media., Tweet to Erin Brockovich too. https://twitter.com/erinbrockovich Good for you bro, standing up against a huge company as one person is never easy, but the truth always shines brightest. I hope this gets picked up by the media soon All I can do is share on WhatsApp & other social medias.
Good luck. Do you have any link for posting it on the Facebook? I don't have Twitter account so would glad to help spread the word on the Facebook or other medium.

Let's fight this together. Holy shit. well done OP.  You should maybe start an online petition on change.org to garner more support for this cause. I believe you have a very strong reason here to take action. 
The media isn't the only solution to your problem, what you have to do is move to the Courts and fight a battle that you might not want to get yourself involved in. The easiest way is to approach an NGO that will help you go along with your claim.  DO NOT APPROACH GREENPEACE BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT THEY ARE CASH STRAPPED AND CANNOT HELP YOU. 

To prove the poisoning, the first thing that you must do is to send the water out for independent testing. The tests willl come out to be positive for mercury. You have to ensure that this test is not in any way biased. 

Go to a legal NGO that will help fight your claim. The easiest one that I know of is called the Human Rights Law Network (http://www.hrln.org/hrln/). There are other NGOs such as Lawyers Collective also that you can approach that will help fight the case *pro bono*. 

Lastly, yes, the media will help you fight your battle but you must realise that the media also has its limitations and will not help you beyond a point. The pressure that you can put on the corporates by approaching the Courts is much much higher. Insist on filing a PIL in the High Court or the Supreme Court and it will definitely get reported by the media then. You must act asap, though. 

All the best in this battle. It is one that many have fought and won. (Read all the MC Mehta cases, for example) The Courts are sympathetic towards pollution claims, these days. I hope your case gets heard.  I really, really hope you get the help you need. Pollution pisses me off and I don't know how to help you. I'm grateful I see others pointing you where you need to go. I also won't buy that brand anymore. That's all I have to help, though. :( Neodymium magnets suspended in the water near the distribution outlets. Mercury is magnetic so this may work, i dont have a degree in chemistry and science wasnt my best subject but just an idea... dont know how good it would worj What an evil corporation. Your leaders won't get the message until their casualties at least equal yours. [Mercury does not cause cancer](http://www.epa.gov/mercury/effects.htm) 

>No human data indicate that exposure to any form of mercury causes cancer, but the human data currently available are very limited. Mercuric chloride has caused increases in several types of tumors in rats and mice, and methylmercury has caused kidney tumors in male mice. Scientists only observed these health effects at extremely high doses, above levels that produced other effects. When EPA revised its Cancer Guidelines in 2005, the Agency concluded that neither inorganic mercury nor methylmercury from environmental exposures are likely to cause cancer in humans. 

It certainly causes health problems but not cancer as far as we can tell.  

 Without knowing how the water is collected, Burn some trees into charcoal and run the water through it prior to use. Layering sand and gravel in a container can achieve the same effect, probably could do both. 

Sadly, once the Mercury has entered the environment, short of major rehab it's gonna be hard to anything but avoid it. 


While it might really suck, this is a time for you and your community to innovate a solution on your own to the direct problem. Even if you get those responsible to admit it, it's not gonna help you guys if you're still drinking contaminated water.  Is $500 USD enough for one person in rural india to survive on per year? That's 32,000 rupee per year in India in rural area... is that enough for say, a kid to survive on? So for example, if a single mother of 2 children (3 people total) had  96,000 rupee per year, is that enoug to survive on? Why are you not telling us the name of the village so that we can help you? Dear UnileverCancerFactor: I was among the small team that uncovered the Unilever's mercury dump in Moonjikal and behind the factory in Pambar Shola in 2001. This campaign has not been in Greenpeace's radar since 2003. However, the ex-mercury workers association along with the Community Environmental Monitoring program of The Other Media has been keeping the campaign alive. What you say is shocking and deserves to be investigated. If the waters from Pambar River are indeed reaching the Varaha, and if people in your village are consumers of river fish, the likelihood of mercury reaching them certainly merits enquiry. You may want to visit our website: kodaimercury.org. I'd be very very keen to look into it and help.

I'm foggy on the details but I remember they get married via standard arranged marriage and then he hates her guts because he had no say in choosing her, she was uneducated, was docile and did her MIL's bidding etc. He then proceeds to teach her (against everyone's wishes and even her protests), gradually develops mutual respect and love,and then when she gets accepted in an American Medical school he forces her to go even when she's reluctant to cross the ocean and leave het family behind. Her life there is documented in the letters she writes him, the latter ones about how the cold has weakened her and then she passes away I guess.

Does anyone else remember watching this? Just looking for a Tamil, Hindu, Brahmin, non-smoking, non-drinking vegetarian.          
(if you're white, that's also alright).  Why is there no Indian movie about her? We have shitty movies about Dhoni, etc. “An Indian woman, a Japanese woman, and a Syrian woman all walk into a bar” sounds like the beginning of a really good joke Thank you for sharing this picture. These women are trailblazers and role models. Any guesses what place Seranysore would be?

Update: It's Serampore in West Bengal. Sabat M. Islambouli (? - 1941) was one of the first Syrian female physicians.[1] She was a Kurdish Jew from Syria

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabat_Islambouli They have a school named after the Indian lady in my city.  I remember a watching TV series about Anandabai DD National every Saturday, I guess

Her story is truly inspiring :) When Sanskaar and Science went hand in hand. Charlie's Angels? Tokio, Japan?  Perfect r/oldschoolcool material right here.. nice share Come on. Are we actually expected to believe that women can be doctors? What's gonna be next-a man on the moon? Give me a break. Asian POWER!!!!! Please x-post to r/oldschoolcool [deleted] Any of them go on to great successes? Or any follow up on the names?

Cool picture regardless. I assume they dressed in cultural attire specifically for the picture.  Thank you for sharing.

"Incredible India.  Where do these tourists always find those typical pants??. They look comfy af and I want a pair but I never see them in normal stores. Do they get issued at the airport when you land as a tourist?? I just finished an overnight journey in AC 3 tier. It was amazing. I love the scenes on train stations, people on train and looking out the window or door. It’s just mesmerising to me. It’s like slow chill traveling with lots of people and great scenery. This picture just shows a beautiful glimpse of it.  Always felt like a window up there in the upper berth would have been so cool! I can smell the Indian Railways AC carriage just by looking at the photo Gori hippie and a desi hippie in the same pic Love Indian trains all my life. So many wonderful encounters through the years.Tinsukia Kalka express rajdhani etc Also copped Delhi Belly big time last year when I asked for tea on board Kalka to Delhi Shatabdi ( i usually never do that, station tea is hot which I prefer, but we had nothing to do) and ended up drinking a Luke warm lousy tea. Whole night and next day right up to evening flight and all the way to Seattle I got the shits of shits. I was a spray bottle and someone was just pulling the trigger every 30 Seconds. I never was far away from a toilet until the taxi ride to the airport and the 3 1/2 hr jet airways line. Yikes! I think my prayers may have gotten involved a bit at the airport and I had nothing to give anyways. It was just vacuum inside. This after spending 3 months in India eating anything everywhere with my family traveling but a bit cautious with water. Yup I still prefer trains if I have time. Babaji ne AC ka ticket kaise afford kar liya? Yaha ham jhand zindagi mai mehmat kar k bhi afford ni kr pa re Not pictured: sheltered Indian men staring at white woman unabashedly.

One of the very few pictures where India isn’t shown as a country of snake charmers and cows. Refreshing. Kudos to the photographer  Credit

Op do you claim this photograph?

 Legit one of the best India pics I've seen. The similar postures (with objects of their choice: Damru and smartphone) is what really makes it.  ""Discovering herself"" One of the best photos I have seen in a long time More like “Western Caucasian Hippie Girl in a Train in India” ""Incredible pic""  For a moment I thought he is also busy with a smartphone. Was pleasantly surprised. We had this prof give us an assignment with this unique spin that the topic can be any damn thing on the earth but you need to write 1000 words. All original content. 
I wrote about Indian Railways. Too many observations and experiences. Although I am away from India now but can never forget railways.  This is my photo.. White people who go to India have the worst fucking dress sense. But damn do they look comfy.  [deleted] Shared this on r/pics . Excellent photo! [deleted] Ivan Venko Can I borrow this pic?

 Brilliant photo. It happens only in India had to convince myself really hard that it was just one picture It's really an amazing picture! I loved the contrast between the two subjects Not shown, the white woman traumatized after being groped, or seeing a guy masturbating, or getting robbed.

All three have happened to my friends who are goris in Indian trains. I love how well this photo hides all the shit out of the view 👍 Replace with a pic of boy shitting in the view from the window [deleted] Can you explain what is incredible about this picture?  [deleted] Did you take permission from both of them before taking the picture? And for posting online?  You never know.......
They both may be playing as a team on PUBG! Thats a good benefit of trains like these no? 😂 both wackos Any Goa beach side store in Anjuna or Baga or any other flee market Some people are considered less valuable than others based on who they were born too, as declared by the people who placed themselves in the highest caste. Btw what are the rules or laws regarding taking photos of people in public places w/o their consent.

Not saying OP took the photo w/o consent as someone commented that it was the friend of the lady at lower birth.  I hope you took their consent before taking the picture and posting it here. Don't take pictures without them knowing. India Shining Creepy much?  Is this OP? I like it. This picture says a lot.  For ex: look at what is keeping both of them busy. The sadhu is carrying so much spiritual bling! Anyone else can smell this picture? In India, even in 2019, there is no equality for women! [removed] [deleted] Fuck, I can smell this picture.

These articles claim that she was in the midst of taking a “daredevil selfie” when the accident happened. Some even state that the youngsters were careless because they visited the beach despite there being numerous warnings against the same. Not only are these claims uncorroborated, but also they are false and present a version of events which did not take place at all, which only shows the sheer lack of responsibility and ethics displayed by the news channels and media houses concerned. 

The articles claim she fell 300ft from the top of a **lighthouse** after she **slipped** while taking a selfie. When in reality she was never on a lighthouse, and the she never slipped from said lighthouse and she was not taking a selfie on said lighthouse. The newspaper even got the location wrong, it mentions a different beach.

**Actual Events:**

Pranita, who was a student of National Law University, Jodhpur, was visiting Gokarna with four of her friends. They were at Kumta beach, and were sitting on some rocks which were about 10-15 feet above sea, when due to unexpected high tide, 3 of the youngsters, including the deceased, were flown away by a giant wave. Two of them were brought back to the shore by another wave, but the deceased, whose glasses had come off, continued to struggle as she held on to a rock for support she bravely struggled  and tried to swim for 45 mins. Unfortunately, she lost her grip, and was carried towards the deeper end of the sea by the waves. 
The friends promptly called the Police as well as the Management of the Hotel they were staying at, and proceeded to seek help from the local residents from a nearby village. However, they could not understand the youngsters’ plea for help, and by the time they did send some help, about forty minutes had already passed and the deceased was out of sight. She was brought back ashore on a boat by some of the local fishermen, and was pronounced dead by the authorities. Her body was taken for post-mortem and was handed over to her relatives afterwards.

**She was an amazing person**, extremely intelligent, she was the class topper and represented  India and NLUJ at prestigious events such as Jessup, she was kind and warm hearted. Her batchmates, teachers, seniors and even our Alumni have been rallying on facebook and on twitter, spreading the story of what really happened and contacting government officials (Arun jately among others) to take some action against these newspapers but I doubt they will listen to a hundred students. Her family has been mourning the loss of their great daughter, the last thing they need is her being mocked and laughed at for dying while taking a selfie.

All we want is that her family is not harassed by untrue depictions of the event which belittle the huge amount of respect that she has earned through her hardwork. 

I would request you to please check your facts before publishing such news articles.


This is also a reminder to all of  you that everytime you read a story where the victim died in this way might actually just be a cooked up tale. 

For Pranita.

Edit: Guys please, if something here offends you then please let me know, but please do not downvote this, we dont want her to be remembered this way, we want to get the true story out.

 Although words cannot express how greatful I am to Reddit India, words are all I have. So please accept my sincerest appreciation for what you guys have done today, you have, even though you are hundreds of miles from her parents , reduced their suffering in a small way. I and her friends will be eternally greatful  to reddit India for rallying behind this cause, when we band together we can achieve anything, and even though we sit behind screens we have the power to affect people in real life. Thankyou all for believing this story.

Thankyou guys so much once again, and thanks to the mods for being so cooperative. Thankyou ScoopWhoop for owning up to the mistake and not ignoring the truth when it came out. This post is now being circulated all over facebook and my college thanks to the efforts of reddit India.
 
 To Pranita, 
I hope you are in a better place, the college will forever miss seeing your radiating smile everyday.

To those reading, the best thing to do in honour of Pranitas memory is to ensure such places carry warning signs alerting visitors of dangers, as suggested by a redditor [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4m5l2k/my_friend_passed_away_and_toi_made_a_mockery_of/d3t7u30?context=3)

 Dear Content stealers of scoopwhoop,

Do something worthy for once. Copy this and make it famous. 

Edit:As much I hate you,Scoopwhoop. 

 Thank you for finally reporting the truth. 

# Satyamev Jayathe.  /u/ForPranitaThrowaway You and all people fighting to get correct version out of story , it may not be in your agenda but can you guys file RTI and get information about accidental deaths reported at said place ?  Pranita and her friends were sitting on rock and flown away by a giant wave. Hence there should be demarcation/warning signs to avoid future tragedies. NLUJ has the worst luck. I've heard stories of raped girls not telling their families what truly happened. Now this. My best friend (who studies in NLUJ) cried her eyes out when she heard of this, specially the bullshit selfies crap. She apparently was just sitting on the rocks. When the high tide came, everybody else could hold on to something while she just has moss. I hope TOI fixes their story. As a Nova Scotian. I know all to well about life being whisked away by the Sea.

We have our own beach deathtrap called Peggy's Cove. Unfortunately people will sit on the dark rocks and then disappear into the ocean.

Sorry about your friend.  Sorry for your loss.

Honestly, even if she had died by slipping while taking a selfie, people die by slipping and falling all the time. It doesn't mean a lack of intelligence. Why pick just the TOI for your title when The Hindu has done the same too? All my sympathies are with you. And I hate these news sites too. Scoopwhoop should be demolished. 

Anyway, for a situation like this, someone can come up and say everything is uncorroborated about the incident. If the beach warnings were uncorroborated, even the part about ""she was not taking a selfie"" can be called out as uncorroborated. 

I was thinking about how can we prove she was not taking a selfie? We can't. Unless someone in authority(like the cops etc) goes around and gathering witnesses. Which we all know is not gonna happen as this has already been tagged a ""natural death"" cause by the cops.

I have been to Gokarna a couple of times in the past. And it does get several rounds of high tides at any time of the day. I have no idea but I suppose it is because of the unusual topography of the place. And any sensible person would not linger around the water when there are warnings being displayed. Yes, they do have warning signs posted whenever there are major changes in the water level predicted.

It is really not sensible to be in the sea water unless you are geared to be there at that point. Watch any Youtube video with the search tag ""surfer safety in sea water"".  Here is a word cloud of every comment in this thread, as of this time: http://i.imgur.com/YwHUnPn.jpg

My cousin (also Indian) lost her husband on their honeymoon when he walked out too far on some rocks and a wave pulled him into the water and he drowned. She couldn't swim and nearly drowned because she dove in to try and find him and pull him up. TOI is the scum of journalism world. It's a great loss to the family..she was one if the most cheerful person and still can belive this and to top it all social media and news have taken it next level.. Please show thr facts and not show morphed news.. Miss u 😔 pranu Dear OP, I know what you said is true, I have a friend who studies at NLU jodhpur. He was horrified after reading the news articles as well, thanks for posting it here and making more people aware. May she RIP, I hope you guys being from a Law Uni could actually do something about this, may be sue the bastards! Very sorry for your loss. Sorry about your loss! I am wondering how did these news folks latched on to this selfie story to being with. :Internet hugs: kudos to you for keeping level headed while undergoing this terrible ordeal.  I had never seen her not happy, and this makes me sad. TIL classmates are called batchmates in India Makes you wonder if the other story that's being advertised in ""read more""is true: https://imgur.com/8ucoM2p Terrible to know how the media reported it. Shows how fact finding has taken a back burner and sensationalising news, even at the cost of such a tragedy, is all what they care for. 

As for Pranita. It was amazing to know you out of our whatever little interactions. Learned quite a few things, especially about smart work. Lots of prayers and strength to the family.  Seems like Indian press is trying to make a narrative of Western-influenced narcissism of young students. (You know because there were never such a thing as narcissistic Indians before) You should write an article  about this on Medium.com. Take some quotes from your friends and include it in the article. 

Well,  TOI is a propaganda reporting station. If you tell mourning family members that their daughter /grand daughter is died because of taking selfie they will believe it because they seek some reasoning for their unexpected loss. That's exploitation of vulnerable family to support their own  propaganda. If they did not provide any evidence then I am with you. 

Can you confirm one thing?  If she wasn't taking selfie did you guys (survived friends) locate her mobile phone from hotel room or any other place which might help some extent for your Version.  Here you go - http://www.scoopwhoop.com/Remember-The-Law-Student-Who-Died-While-Clicking-A-Selfie-In-Gokarna-The-Story-Is-Apparently-False/

I hope others pick it up too But did the deceased have a smartphone in their hand and was it positioned in such a manner as one would interpret as someone taking a selfie when the said giant waves hit the deceased? u/ForPranitaThrowaway
PLEASE submit this to the logical Indian on FB or their website. It will get huge social media exposure and will open the eyes of the social media users. I have been to Kumta beach, as its next to native village and on the rocks mentioned above. It is known danger spot and I can understand if the youngsters were not aware of it. Sorry for your loss this is why i hate the media. journalists are such scum nowadays. Thank God for r/india. Else none of us would ever have seen this true version. Thanks to everyone who upvoted this and got this the reach it deserved The [last link](http://aajtak.intoday.in/story/death-of-a-young-man-fell-in-the-dam-while-taking-selfie-1-867924.html) you put on your post is about a guy... are you sure its the ""same"" story? For starters, that's not a TOI video but an ANI video, which TOI has sourced. Ditto OneIndia.

Secondly, no one would report this from hearsay. This must be the version the police have given out. 

Thirdly, the Hindu article says she was clicking the selfie NEAR the lighthouse, not ON it.

And the Aaj Tak report is an entirely different one!

Really sorry for your loss, but also compelled to say your ire is misdirected. If you need someone to talk to. please feel free to reach out to me. All my sympathies to you, your friend and the family of the poor girl. Do take down the picture of the FIR (letter, not the printed copy) with your names on it and re-upload it after censoring that line. Probably overkill, but in this day and age, a name and a college are enough to track down anyone. live your life as she would want you to. respect what she was not given.
be happy with your life as she would. Some people haven't read the actual story still they are giving downvotes. Please do read full story and then do anything.These negative reactions can hurt feelings of people who loved her. Journalism is a shame nowadays. 

You have my heartfelt sympathies. I could not even imagine how horrible and shocking reading a cooked up tale about a close one's passing away would feel. 

May Pranita Rest In Peace.  I've never heard of scoopwhoop but I certainly won't read or ever use any of their publications. That's just lazy and insensitive work. Most upvoted post on r/india!!!  Thankyou randians >Don't believe the newspapers.  
  
Ok. So, what gives me a reason to believe you ? No source, Throwaway. OP looks shady. > However, they could not understand the youngsters’ plea for help

Why ?? Wouldn't approaching press council of India make more sense than Facebook campaigns or approaching politicians? Also, I am guessing significant lawyer network available who can file case against ANI/ToI and get the story retracted and apology issued scoopwhoop should pick this story to ~~steal~~ report. much more authentic and useful to the readers than a casual rant.. fucking news media. for the amount of content stealing they do from reddit, at least majority of the newspapers have retracted the story. disgusting state of affairs Who comes up with the ideas of planting stories...over somebody's death to make it more ""exciting"". This is insane and morbid! Sorry for your loss, OP.  Modern journalism is a joke everywhere it seems.  I'm glad for you OP, but I'm sorry for your loss. This is such lazy journalism. If TOI picked up this obviously fabricated story from sahilonline, and other newspapers followed it blindly, without any research or proof, makes me wonder what information are we getting May her soul rest in peace. Sorry to hear about your friend

Oddly enough I actually just read this fake story today. Was linked from a different article and was picked up by a UK paper, think it was in Mirror online  Wow .. what just happened on Randia..this looks to be the topmost upvoted story of all time..
Using reddit to shame news reporting is not new, but this is at a different level altogether... 
A big thumbs up to the friend who actually proved the adage - "" A friend in need is a friend indeed"" She was really lucky to have friends like you. Well done OP. Toi is shit and we all know that. RIP your friend.  Why does the scoopwhoop link have all the information/address on it? Also, I can understand they may have needed some proof to corroborate, but why publish the post mortem report etc? > Although words cannot express how greatful I am to Reddit India, words are all I have.

Thankyou all for believing this story. That's really sad and I'm sorry. You shouldn't be surprised of the medias reaction though. They only care about money and all integrity is gone.  How exactly did this story get published and spread? 

Was there a particular source of the miss-information?  Anything beyond the local news seems to feel like it's become a 14 year olds list of everyone that sucks.  ""She is the class topper"".

https://youtu.be/kJa2kwoZ2a4 Thanks for sharing the true story. Faith in Reddit....Restored... This is why I love Reddit!!!  And now TOI's site yields a 404. Just noticed, David Wong from Cracked tweeted this submission. Should help it get more views.
 My deepest sympathies. Almost something like this happened to my wife and son on mammlapuram beach, sitting on the huge rock, with sudden tide rising and ensuing panic. Luckily we all were able to escape unhurt. So it is a terrible idea of sitting on these rocks.  I am sorry to hear this and about three months ago I was involved in an almost identical scenario although fortunately we all survived. We watched this shelf above the waves for about 15 minutes and no wave ever touched it. So we decided to go onto the shelf to take pictures and 1 big wave came and knocked me sodeways into the rocks and wedged my ankle which got sliced up and broken and it sucked the girl out into the ocean.

She was swimming for about 5 minites before another biggish wave came and pushed her back up onto the rocks and i grabbed her and pulled her up onto the shelf. We then got our other friend and hobbled out of there.

I also lost my glasses and it was insanely scary at how quick it occured.

I am in Guam. I go hiking almost every weekend. I try to be as careful as possible but the ocean is very dangerous. Journalism today has become a joke, RIP Pranita. Kudos to you OP.  See this is the power of reddit and Internet as a whole. Glad publications are retracting their story.

My heart goes out to the family of that young woman. RIP.  You are a good friend! Well done, I hope she is in an even better place now. > tried to swim for 45 mins.

> promptly called police


Which is it? [deleted] As someone who lives in Hawaii, maybe she didn't take a selfie as stated, but you should ALWAYS respect the ocean.  I have heard about tons of tourists who have died due to being unexpectedly swept off the rocks.  Always makes the news, and we always just shake our heads.  Most the time these people are simply not familiar with the sea, but it also happens to the best.

Again, always respect the ocean.  My favorite phrase is ""when you enter the water, you enter the food chain"" RIP, you friend.  Goddamn corporate media b*stards one again proved : dont READ **TOI**LET, **SHIT**SCOOP

my sympathies for you and your friend's family's tragic loss. Life is SO unpredictable. :( It's a great loss to the family..she was one if the most cheerful person and still can belive this and to top it all social media and news have taken it next level.. Please show thr facts and not show morphed news.. Miss u 😔 pranu I just really wish people do not rely on ScoopPoop and TOIlet paper for their news. 

So sorry about your friend. She seems like a beautiful human being! Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. A non-native English speaker correctly using affect instead of ""effect?"" Amazing! The wonders never cease.

I am truly sorry for your loss. A beautiful, intelligent young woman cut down before her life has even really begun is a great tragedy. Very sad. You are a good friend for going to all this effort to preserve her good name. what is important is that you spread the message of not sitting on tide rocks, not swimming in tide pools or sitting on rocks where dam release water may flow.  

and not go on a tirade against a newspaper that will continue to report such incidents in exactly the same way irrespective of Sh. Arun Jaitleyji telling them to mend their ways. 

pick the important lessons.  Hey,  I really get your point here. These tv news channels will actually do anything to get their trp high.  There are very very few ethical news companies remaining in this world. The journalists will almost always change up and modify the original story.    In 2014, there was a very popular tv series which came out in South Korea.  It highlights this very sensitive issue in about 20 episodes. Since you being a friend of the victim, I highly suggest you watching this show of 20 episodes. The name is [Pinocchio](http://myasiantv.se/drama/pinocchio/)    Please let me know what you think of it. I actually suggest everyone who upvoted this topic here on reddit india to watch this tv series. It's rated very good by critics and even though you will watch it with English subtitles, I promise you will like the way they handle this issue.  I just saw the TOI video, they definitely did not portray it as a joke. Literally just said that she slipped while taking a selfie which seems accurate. Also why should we believe you anyway? Why are you a more credible source than them? You know, if you had not mentioned that this girl was your friend and had only posted the news articles, half of randia would have given her the Darwin award. First of all I'm sorry for your loss.

The thing is,we really can't know who to trust with this. The cause of death may be bringing more pain to you and you may be trying to fix that by giving another version. Or may be this is just lies on the media's part. We just can't tell.

But no matter what happened writing ""funny"" headlines is really out of line and her achievements absolutely must not be belittled because of this. [deleted] Lol @ we did it! Did it for what exactly? Doesn't matter what is published,  your friend is gone somehow through her own stupidity by climbing up a rock. And congrats for letting every facebook majnu know about this place.  >She was an amazing person, extremely intelligent, she was the class topper and represented India and NLUJ at prestigious events such as Jessup, she was kind and warm hearted.


/r/nocontext


Also, the news sites like scooppoop already got their publicity which then they increased 2x by posting a ""Sorry, we will still keep fucking you up every story lol"" This is one of those stories..... Emotional . Sorry, why should we believe you ?

the only ""proof"" you have is what looks like a copy of FIR, but it has nothing to corroborate your version. May I point out that Trump is absolutely correct about the dishonesty and moral bankruptcy of the media in distorting the reality for personal gain instead of doing their jobs. Its toi learn to ignore it,arguing with toi is like arguing with a wall. Sorry for your loss. I might sound blunt but please understand that it doesn't matter what the exact circumstances of your friend's death were. Whether she was taking a selfie or someone else was clicking her photo or she was just standing there the matter of fact is it was an accident. See what you can do to ensure others don't get into similar accidents or atleast get help when they are in need.

Make her accident serve as an example that highlights dangers of nature.

I have lost some friends. I miss them a lot but I don't really care how they passed away. This is pretty sad. She seemed pretty hot. how will politicians and government officials help you? newspapers misreport and misinterpret what politicians and other public personalities say all the time and if they try to do something about it they'll be skinned alive in public for stifling the press. In fact our journalists make up outrageous stories and narratives in so many cases of murders, rapes and many other crimes in the country which then get reprinted and shared around the world. There is nothing we can do except to recognize the standard of journalism in our country and not blindly believe and get carried away by everything we read in the press.",[R]eddiquette

"Hindu cop standing guard as Muslim comrade offers namaz (photo shared by Srinagar Sector CRPF on Twitter)  Namaz being the word for Muslim prayer, for those who don't know. [deleted] Was he ""standing guard"" or just waiting for his partner to finish because what else is he supposed to do? I went to Srinagar once. Even corner had a CRPF man. It was scary :( I hope Indian peace returns to J&K, instead of Pakistani/Islamic peace. What are we? Some kind of facebook? This warms my heart. But I think the wedge between both the communities is deeper than we think.

I am from a Hindu family and most of my relatives are islamophobic. My father who was a veterinarian is of the opinion that India should have been declared a Hindu country. Since he is the most educated person in his circle, people actually listen to him talk about these things. Worse yet, he is part of a group that goes around capturing photos of temples in South India. He blames the Islamic rulers for destroying temples. But the tone he uses when he talks about the persecution of Jains by Hindu kings blatantly shows his hypocrisy. 

I just told this so that some people can know that there are ""educated"" hypocrites out there and India has to deal with them. Brothers in arms >*grab a popcorn*

>*sort by controversial* Iconic Image. Why the fuck do we need to explicitly show that we have compassion towards Muslims? It shouldn't be news at all. It should be common place regardless of cast or religion or gender to have basic etiquette and compassion towards others (human beings, animals). You see, that's what makes us homo sapiens/social animals/human beings. This only makes it worse.  The guy praying was gonna go inside, but the cop said, 

'namaz... Stay.'  I don't get it. You are a soldier. No religious text force you to do this everywhere at all costs. Why do this religious appeasement thing in such a crucial time? This indicates a weak point that the enemy can easily use against these officers.  And yet, the same person will often kill many a kashmiri muslims -
 cause of his duty and the other reason being - he does not know them. 

That is the whole thing here. Almost any Hindu/Muslim will do the same for another Muslim/Hindu **whom they know**. 

Only when the other person is someone whom we don't know - do things get out of hand. Even when someone is rioting, you will often see the rioting crowd go a certain distance and then get down to business (arson, lynching whatever). One of the reasons is to be the unknown face in another area, but the other reason is someone doing something bad to someone you know very well, is actually quite difficult. 

As Guha says, you need the roti-beti rishta between ethnic groups for them to live harmoniously with each other. 

For all the elite and iitiim- matrimonies dot coms.. I really wish someone came up with interreliginomatrimony.com where the spouses are necessarily from different religions...but alas in today's times - there is no money to be made there to be frank enough.

 Why does CRPF weak Khaki Police uniform.

Thats why most people can not distinguish between CRPF  and the Civil Police (when they're in Khakis) and from the Army (when they are in camouflage). A that an FN Fal?? He'll never get a kill streak with that f'ing fail of a gun.  I love this photo.  there is hope At first I thought he had a fucking sword.  That would have been epic. Is that a sword? Looks like this made to the front page! This is what RSS and BJP hates. They want every Hindu to hate Muslims just like how Muslim bigots want every Muslim to hate Hindu.  [deleted] Lol he took off his knee pads to get on his knees. should win nat geo photo of the year.. so deep man and pure! This is India.  [removed] [deleted] how do we know the officer on guard is Hindu? Their uniforms look different. From different units/teams I guess? I love his guard stance  We could learn from this shit right here  Off topic, but is the Indian solider holding a modified FN FAL? Aren't those things from the 60's? What gun is he holding? Whats the deal with that baton? It looks like clear plastic with sand in it. Any special reason for having that? This picture sums up who we basically are. Dont let the media define us any differently. 

Hindustan Zindabaad. People should not glorify worship. It is devotion to the biggest scam perpetrated on humanity. You would not hold up an Amway proponent in the same regard.  Nationalism, Hindu, Secular...whenever these words are used in a thread, people start jumping from their seats to claim that their definition is the only correct one. 

It almost sounds like my imaginary God vs your imaginary God. 


You need to relax guys.

 Yeh baat! I have no idea about the implications of this, but is comrade used as its leftist connotation here? RESPECT Can we all agree that both religions are really fucking stupid? [removed] If the muslim's god is real, shouldn't *it* stand guard? So ? 

I am serious, why is it such a big deal ?  What's he holding in his hand? that sprites prolbly warm..and flat lol I too understand that this is a positive thing to share, but isn't religion being an unnecessary risk to life of someone who's not even a follower of the said religion, here, by the fact that the soldiers would be better off if both of them were on the lookout for each other rather than one stopping to conduct his body in a fashion to appease an imaginary being? Just had a saffrogasm.  Somebody tweet this to Modi  The dude in the back is ready to use the sword to defend his buddy Sprite brings people together. And they are both accepting of mind-poison. Bummer. There's something marvellous about a mustachio'd policeman like that. Khada hoke timepass kar raha hai aur isme top post bana di [deleted] 1. ""Hindu"" (how do you know?) guard is not guarding the muslim comrade while he does namaz. He is doing what he would have done regardless - guard/patrol whatever it is they were assigned to.
2. Not something to be encouraged. He is supposed to be guarding something and he is not.  What if its an execution?

:thinking: Why is the guy standing guard holding a big baton with his trigger hand? Seems like it get in the way if he actually had to defend the guy Actually a great photo. But seriously, would a Muslim protect a kuffars right to carry out their religious practices? [removed] I am confused, are we supposed to hate kashmiris and muslims or not?

"Tigress Samruddhi with her four cubs at the Aurangabad zoo. The cubs, including two white, were born on Saturday morning.  Took me a moment to find the fourth one. Can't wait for the awkward dinner when the husband comes home and sees the white one. Source- [The Hindu](https://epaper.thehindu.com/Home/ShareImage?Pictureid=GK55PJLEU.2) Credit to Mr Yogesh Londhe

The white fur caused by a lack of the pigment pheomelanin, which is found in Bengal tigers with orange color fur. For a white Bengal tiger to be born, both parents must carry the unusual gene for white colouring, which only happens naturally about once in 10,000 births. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_tiger) Tigress just ran out of ink. Must be very difficult for them, Aurangabad is known for its heat All the best to these young critters She is one majestic mom.  

 Also , thanks for  high quality pic . Looks great as my new wallpaper What's the survival rate for cubs born in captivity for tigers? Wow the cubs are as big as my grown cat Is this only a part of the tigress's accommodation or the cell is really small? Is it just the picture or are they in some very limited space? Beautiful. Wish our population was such that we could give atleast 30% of land to them without a proper road passing thru, allow just a few tourists in every season ... make non humans the owners Albino (white) cubs are an indication of a close genepool. It's kind of sad, actually. They don't occur as frequently in nature as they do in captivity. I love the fact that we as a nation, really care about our animals. We should really have programs that eventually release them in the wild. Can't imagine the life they'll have in cages [Word cloud out of all the comments.](https://i.imgur.com/ii5ppX6.png)

Fun bot to vizualize how conversations go on reddit. Enjoy The father needs to ask some questions. r/aww I just want to hold them in my hand. Feel their furr and purr. They are so beautiful. They’re not born to be in cage or “zoo”!! Please don't support this. Please educate yourselves if the following is news to you.

White tigers are bred despite having a myriad of health problems and not living nearly as long as normal tigers. Kidney and spine issues, crossed optic nerves etc. White tigers is a sign of a bad zoo (unless it's a sanctuary rescuing abused or neglected animals, which is where the abysmally few lucky ones end up). All the cubs in this picture likely have similar health issues. 

Iirc, for every white tiger, roughly thirty others were discarded (sold to roadside zoos, circuses or straight up killed/sold to people practicing traditional medicine). And then I haven't even touched on the white tigers that don't have the right proportions, who are also discarded. 

It's not conservation, it's exploitation. Everyone will pay to see a white tiger. Now that you know, please, choose not to. ❤ Animals in captivity always look so sad. Hate the fact that the photo captures the two walls they are confined in See thanos? Halving the living creatures won't help. I am very happy 2 albinos I heard Bengal tigers have been pushed out of bengal because of overdevelopment by Bengalis. They mostly live in south India now. 

Can anyone confirm? The cubs are the size of her feet. She can make them into slippers Aren't white tigers just a result of inbreeding in Tigers? What a tiny enclosure :( The mother is het (-erozygous) so there is a 1/4 chance for white cubs if the father is also het or a 1/2 chance if the father is white. I really want to pet the cubs. cute cubs scary mom Are they twins? It would be less rare if they were twins correct? I just got hit by a tsunami of nostalgia. Visiting Siddharth garden/zoo (Aurangabad zoo) every weekend with my Dad as a four-five year-old is one of my fondest memories. So many hours spent watching fascinating animals... This was around twenty five years ago. Thanks OP! Adorable Newborn infant baby cubs. But where is the fourth one? They belong in the wild They shouldn’t keep them in the Zoo. They don’t belong there Interracial marriage cuties 😁 Tiger mom Super like! Where's free the nipple movement now? Can a normal tiger give birth to white tigers without cross breeding? Tiger conservation is one of those few things that this country has been getting right. Damn that space is small. Hey it's my city , welcome everyone
But having said that their life expectancy is less than average in my city due to negligence of their health care and food .
The zoo is in news from last decade for the same , I hope they get transferred to some reputed one or in wild life sanctuary Omg What? Aryan tiger cubs? Such qts!!!! :3

I hope they are taken good care of at the zoo tbh! why is she in a cage This zoo looks terrible. Aah our siddharth garden near bustand *happiness noise* White tiger is a sign of inbreeding Nice. Are they 'purebred'? I remember reading somewhere that not only white tigers but  tigers in general in captivity in were so mixed due to inbreeding and cross-breeding from different sub species they could never be eligible to help wild populations. White tigers are born out of tiger incest, so there's that. [deleted] 😍 Lovely Albinos The zoo can offer these cubs to be petted by general public for a fee, where people can photograph holding these cubs. It can be a good source of income. Just look at Thailand. Obviously not right now, just when the cubs are big enough. [removed] Definitely not higher than a retreat . Problem is the mother would like to feast on the weak ones . I could be wrong tho but my limited knowledge on animal behaviour in captivity leads me to make this opinion .",Non-Political

"My father has been taking the same bus to work and back for the last 5 years. Today, all the regular commuters gave a farewell to the bus conductor on his last working day.  [removed] A-ha, this is in Mumbai. NMMT or TMT buses. I traveled by these for almost 3 years for one of my jobs. 

You make friends with your conductors very fast when you have an 1.5 hour one-way commute every day. They always have change for you, tell you about the next available seat if you dont get your usual seat. Ask about you if you dont turn up for a day or two. And they never ever fell ill. It's a thankless job but they do it day in and day out. 

I freakin love that these commuters did this for their conductor. Much love. As a kid I wanted to be a bus conductor when I grew up. I used to see his money pouch and thought if so many people give him money he must be so rich! I love happy news... ""To know that even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded."" - Ralph Waldo Emerson

Your father and other regular commuters managed to show him just that. The conductor would remember this sweet gesture forever. r/wholesomeindians The moment I saw this pic I went nostalgic remembering the days when I used to travel to my college in Ghodbunder Road, Thane. I used to take NMMT/BEST (700/AC-700) or TMT buses from Borivali. I still remember I used to pay INR 35 (AC-700) for a single journey ticket (Borivali to Kasarvadavli) and then when the business kicked-in, BEST began shooting the price in a slow and steady manner. I think I paid around \~INR 50-55 (may be INR 70 even, not sure, this was years back) the last time I traveled in AC-700. You'd be surprised but the Thane AC buses (don't remember if it was NMMT or TMT; I think TMT) charged INR 25 for the same journey! That too for a relatively lengthy period of time, despite the hike in AC-700's ticket costs.

&#x200B;

A side note: the ST buses were the BEST experience! Especially the red colour one that is so famous for its speed and maneuvering, it's got a class for itself. It's called ""lal dabba."" Borivali to Kasarvadavali in 30-35 minutes. This was back during the class of 2010 (August) and right until October 2012.

&#x200B;

Edit: Price hike by BEST wasn't slow and steady. In fact, it was aggressive. Sorry! Where is this? Very heartwarming 😊 r/MadeMeSmile This is quite common if you go to tier 2/3 city where there are a lot of middle aged people. My uncle and his friends took local train between Araah and Patna everyday for work. They knew a lot of ticket collector and guards. Heck, sometimes they travelled in the last car in which the guard travels. They knew each other well, and what was happening in each other's family etc. I think the generation before me (people born before 1985) was much more social in their ways and really acknowledged each other's presence. Everyone knew everyone back then. But now people are just glued to their mobile screens. They don't know who lives next door. They don't socialize with people whom they run into everyday in public transport. And yet they have 500+ fb friends and 1000+ instagram followers. Did bring a smile on my face :) While travelling in a bus abroad, I always used to admire how warmly the passengers and the bus driver greeted each other, always a polite thank you.

Always wondered why aren't we so courteous and appreciative of each other in public life

Guess I was wrong, there is awesomeness everywhere!  Nice! There's still some humanity left. This looks like bangalore BMTC volvo. Feels so good to read such stuff. 

Small gestures like this can sometimes make a huge difference.  Usually this subreddit is filled with negative posts, but thank you so much for sharing this. This is absolutely so beautiful. Made my day! A friend told me last year that his Father has taken the same bus for quite some time now and all the regular commuters had become such good friends that they hosted a Secret Santa in the bus and got gifts for each other. That was a truly wholesome thing to hear. 

P.S.- It was also an NMMT bus. Really awesome and wholesome pic.💓

P.S.-Why the hell are people downvoting harmless comments? 🤔 Worli Naka to Andheri W. ftw Wow, that's very nice of them. How long did your father work as a bus conductor? Is the pay good enough to support a family? Which city ? Mumbai ? Public transport goals. r/UpliftingKhabre Uplifting news. [deleted] This honestly makes me so happy. r/upliftingnews These are small celebrations which are keeping my faith in humanity. Rather than politics, hatred , I prefer to read this type of stories. It's rare stuff that I read on this subreddit makes me really happy :'). Proud of OP's dad and friends  This is probably my favourite thing about India.  r/HumansBeingBros Did anyone ever thanked the bus driver? Even i had a dtc bus for regular commute and now its all on news for molestation charges :( Who's gonna thank the bus driver! r/HumansBeingBros Nice 125? Aww. This is nice. But who’s driving the bus?!   Wow. This make smile in my face. 😍 So good. Front page stuff!  I thought this happened in some Western country, where bus passengers and drivers/conductors are more humane. This is so great! Is this Delhi? r/humansbeingbros Woaah!!! ❤️❤️❤️ Positive news Aww that's so wholesome Wow, this is so sweet noice.. r/HumansBeingBros I love such news! Wish him a happy and fulfilling life ahead.
 That’s so cute lol That's really nice.  What is that camera ? edited ? Wow such an amazing picture. Truly humanity is still alive.   Great stuff This is good sign of Humanity. Gr8 gesture. Salute Now that’s what we need more of. I have noticed appreciation is the biggest reward for everyone doing jobs most of us deem unworthy r/WholesomeBusStories  Wholesome gesture 😃 This is so heartwarming.  This made warm and fuzzy inside. Borivali route? Power to all these people. In between all the chaos in the country, news like these, make me feel Indian inside. Lmao in India we thank the bus conductor Class act This is so cool Bus conductor sounds way cooler than bus driver! Wholesome Nice post. Don't they change routes for conductors? Traveled in same bus for many years? your father must be a very disciplined person. Wonderful!  This is too wholesome. Love it!  Damn that's wholesome Very heart touching and inspiring. People do make friends while traveling and places like Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, etc. Still people have Humanity left in them which shown by commuters by giving farewell to the bus conductor. This looks like Pune. Sahi hai yaar. Here in metro nobody gives a fk. This is a surprise. Never happens in Kolkata. What black magic fuckery is this? Nowhere in India have I seen a bus where you actually get space to breathe, let alone stand around and do parties. Ok?  Great.. Small gestures like these make a lot of difference in people's life.. 😃😃☺️ Man. People do that. Amazing!! That's surprisingly empty
 Wow He has been a hardworker. Such people deserve standing ovation.  Totally not a made-up story This is a fine looking bus by Indian public transport standards..  /r/wholesomemes",Non-Political
"Indian Wonder Woman- Cosplay by Deepica Mutyala  Duppata of truth  >Mutyala

Oof, I remember a guy with surname mutneja. Childhood was tough for him Damn someone gilded this 3 times. I'm not even the cosplay girl. I didn't do anything. I just saw this on Twitter and posted here.  Nice :)
Sari is the armour?  Her parents-""Shaadi ki Umar ho gayi bitiya ki"" Did wonder woman just loot a jewellery store? People commenting here should really think outside the stereotypes set (sometimes by themselves) about Indian women.

I find this to be a very neat attempt. All the key features of the WW costume check out here as an Indianized version. Kamala Khan (Ms. Marvel) Pretty cool. Lasso is missing though. Hello I am here from r/all That is a hawt costume. This is cool. She is beautiful. Photo is amazing. Her( and team) attempt is commendable. Wow, but boy does this ruined my imagination of Indianized wonder woman. Danm that cosplay could have been better. *slow clap for opening new path for future cosplayers who attempt this* If the saree had been black, it would have looked more cool. Nice now show Bob and Vagene. Rajinikanth triggered. Kulcha warriors are confused AF. this is so beautiful, someone in hollywood should employ her in costume design  Username check out God. Damn. She is gorgeous!  Greco-Roman armor with Saree and Indian jewellery. Nice combination! Some politician is getting ready to protest against her now. What's up with the shit load of Jewelry? Objectively, this looks like a very poor attempt. Wonder woman is a figure of prowess, emotions and confidence.

This looks like a millennial instagram blogger attempting to get into jewelry advertising business. [deleted] Wow they really did try with the waistring and all that extra.. could have added a nose ring too idk lol I have two good friends their last names are Muttlaya & Pattlya lots of good times ribbing them
with bathroom humor Very cool!! Dayum. Really well done. Props to Deepica. :) So wonder woman + gold?  She is lovely. ooo, the bangles are the wrist shields. Clever. This looks like a fusion of Wonder Woman and Symmetra. >	Mutyala

That sounds a lot like a Telugu surname.  _Indian version of Wonder Woman._

How the hell she will fight with so much jewellery; or she is fighting only with husband? That jewelry is gonna cost her a pretty penny if she comes to india That's badass.  I'd read an Indian Wonder Woman comic for sure.  

I don't know much about Indian mythology, what God would be her arch nemesis? Wow that's a lot of bracelets. Also, wonder woman doesn't wear a cape. Know a guy from college who's name was Annas Shiekh  Next time add this redditgold in the cosplay. holy apsara hiiii
 This attracted lot of hate and racist comments on r/pic.  Insaf ki Devi. Seeing Gal, I don't like her duppata and jewelery. Albeit that's what making the look Indian Exposed knees o_o, not Indian, not enough sanskari. What i want to see, isnt in pic Where’s the talwaar and the shield?
 This is what true ""Nari Shakti"" looks at its full potential. Kudi punjaban lagdi ah Where is Ghungat?  She looks beautiful.

But, she also looks nothing like how a warrior should be like. She can't fight in that dress. Too many loose knots to pull her out of her posture. 

A cosplay is supposed to be accurate as the character. This isn't. This cannot be termed as a cosplay, just a girl dressed up in clothes like Wonder Women. Miami Florida ! Its amazing to see Desi redditors losing their shit over this pretty average cosplay, when this foreign born never indian deepica herself had tagged this cosplay as ""South Asian Wonder Woman"" and never said this is ""Indian"" Looks like a solid Elseworlds story to me. I know a Zawar, which kind of sounds like fucker in Marathi. She looks like my ex ;__; Beautiful! Kya hai yeh kuch bhi ironically this ""Deepica"" is not even Indian..
Born and braught up in Texas..

Ab munh mein le lo apna ""Proud Indians"" Damn how come there’s no Indian women like this where I live?? [removed] Cultural appropriation?  What is the appeal in cosplay?  Man you suck all the fun out of stuff. Brown and proud! May her tribe increase! Clearly, knowledge on the subject is limited.

 Wow. That's not even close.  [removed] ew [removed] In choodiyo ko na thode koi goliya oyyy takurrr.. [removed] Bob [deleted] Cringe. 

Edit: Come on! It certainly looks like a mismatch to me. Saree as a cape? jewellery on a warrior? ",Non-Political
"If you still throw garbage on street.  I used to throw chocolate and chip wrappers on the street till I was in 11th, one day saw a foreign tourist  pick up a chip packet thrown by a desi man and throw it in the bin. Got soo embarrassed, it hurt hard. For me, that's a serious gang talk. The problem with such campaigns is that they tell people to NOT do something. Like ""Don't urinate on streets"", ""Don't litter"" etc.  

The focus should instead be more on having and maintaining enough garbage disposal places. Tell people to ""Use dustbins"" and ""Use Urinals"" and allocate budget on keeping them usable. Does India even provide education I thought it was just degrees These hoardings are so effective,people start littering right below it.  [deleted] Whats the point in anything, while we are at it.
  Lets see if this works better than ""gadhe ke poot yahan mat moot"" [deleted] [deleted] It's shocking and sad to see how many educated people do this ... How else am I gonna establish my superiority? Yeah because only people who know English do the littering I'm creating jobs. /s OP, where in Gangtok is this? Just curious. I have never seen this before.  We should learn a lot from North East which gets Exposure in media only for those military activities and not for other good deeds.  Saw a lot of this or variations there of during my recent trip to Meghalaya. Some of the few places that are still pristine. Saw a lot of tourists try  to throw their plastic bottles off the waterfalls' edges. Also found Rajnigandha packets inside Cherrapunji caves. That was just incredibly awful as you have to go in barefooted. Distinguishing educated and uneducated is pointless here...littering isn't science.   Living in New Delhi. People who live in New Delhi are very disgusting and everyone is in so much attitude. They throw wrapper literally 2-3 feet away from the bin. And when you say someone not to throw it they start fighting (physically fight). So, this is disgusting. 


I really don't know how to handle this and where to complained about these people.  Boom, roasted. So I won't have to pick trash off street? The implication being that the point of education is to teach people not to litter? The intended message is good but there's not much logic to that argument. Sikkim is an amazing place.

And Indians are not ""educated"" people, they are ""literate"" and ""degree holders"". Real, proper 'education' in this country only partially exists and is not available to most. Stumbled to this sub from Canada, surreal to see the culture differences. Even suggesting a class system exists between educated and uneducated people would cause a lot of outrage here. If everyone stops throwing trash on the streets, wouldn't those municipal employees lose their jobs?  
How would they feed their children?  
As a domino effect, 99.5% of our population would be left in the streets.  

Wouldn't it lead to massive unemployment, abject poverty, skyrocketing​ crime, irrecoverable illiteracy, extreme lawlessness and total hopelessness ?    I dont know If I should laugh at this or feel bad. Sick ass burn, man. Would really make a person feel bad for littering /s Look at it this way : an educated person understands the economic condition of the country and hence provides jobs for uneducated people by throwing trash on the street. 

*Insert meme picture of black guy with his finger on his temple* Wow, I actually saw this billboard a week ago when I was going from Darjeeling to Gangtok. OP when were you there? Because cities are giant dumps in the first place.  It is to show those uneducated poor fucks that we can throw shit and they have to pick it up. The problem with us is we want first want others to change.

Do the needful and all of the rest will flow. I keep them in pocket until I see a public trash bin or reach home or office to throw in trash bin. [deleted] This sign needs to be palace in all hospitals, Doctors are slops. The point is to make sure they have a job despite their lack of education. Duhhhh I mean, exactly that? This sign can't be in America. No one's picking up the garbage from what I can see. Ah yes because city-servants are the lowest of the low and they have to be used as a standard of lack of intelligence to discourage the real smart people from throwing their trash on the street. I have picked up other people's wrapers, empty water bottles in Delhi metro and see them tear up in humiliation. Legitimate question, how does trash pickup work in India? Is there a trash day where you leave your crap outside and the guy picks it up? 

On my street there is a dumpster that is 100% of the time overflowed with garbage spilling out into the street. It stinks so bad. This is the case all the time whenever I go visit Smart campaign!  What's with the BBMP rule that you need to pay them Rs 5000 or more for putting a garbage bin in your yard ?  I never threw anything in public after taking an oath at school on Gandhi jayanti. I was in 5th I guess.

I never told anyone about it. I think it's kind of weird 🙄
 Challenge Accepted The entire country is a giant garbage dump Good creating a job opportunity and paying them with my tax money The point is, we are providing employment to the uneducated. SWACH BHARAT! i live in gangtok and when i saw this poster, i was like is it ok if an educated person picks it up...
 So we're low key calling garbage workers stupid.... 630 million people just shit where ever they want, every day, in that god forsaken country.  deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.9985  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/62079) I'm a job creator duh The point of education is that i don't have to pick up my litter../s The point is that I am a job creator. I will keep throwing garbage on the streets for as long as we have garbage politicians running my state (punjab) and country.

"#Profile4Peace #SayNoToWar (x-post from /r/pics)  It's easy to find unity in the Gulf. Indians and Pakistanis both realize that the Arabs/Emiratis are neither of their friends. The familiarity of South Asian always trumps the outright cruelty and sometimes-inhumanity of the people who run these countries. Indians and Pakistanis are both aware that they share a lower rung on the country's ladder, and that the ladder can be kicked aside at any moment. They don't necessarily stick together, but somehow when you look into one another's eyes you feel that solidarity.

Many people glorify the idea of life in the Gulf, but forget how stark it is for many thousands and millions even. These people look well off I guess, but I don't think anyone can live in Dubai without feeling what I'm talking about.

I hope someday India and Pakistan find some common enemy in South Asia who could unite us. 



 I don't hate Pakistanis. I hate terrorists and people who harbour terrorists.  [deleted] The Indian didn't draw a smiley tho I have worked with Pakistanis in IT firm. T**hey are good people like Indians. Same food, attire, slang**. But the **use of Islam in Pakistan's political agenda is scary**. They too agree on this. Pakistan Military thinks they can manipulate and create militia to counter their problems. T**hey even acknowledge the militia presence in their Military regiments.**  [**www.pakistanarmy.gov.pk**](https://www.pakistanarmy.gov.pk)**(Source)**. These many years **Pakistan is taking money and arms in the name of ISLAM**. They portray themselves as the Islamic saviors.  Most of the smart Pakistanis dont want to live in Pakistan anymore. The assassinate their leaders. Military coup is common. How long can India tolerate such unstable country. Its a war India has to fight and fight alone. Today or some other day.  **The only non-military option is to impose sanctions and let the common people die out of hunger and thirst. Will that be okay?** I agree, outside their home country there are many people who would work together or stay together or become brothers or sisters or be best friends or even fall in love with each other. This has been happening since many years.  This what’s happening recently is not a war against nations! most patriots And liberals fails to understand from both sides.. it’s against terrorism sponsored by organisations with wrong intensions in Pakistan, which is in fact killing our soldiers brutally. 

So there must be a hashtag which asks to curb this brutality instead!  This is really wholesome!  Let me clarify. I have utmost respect for all the common Pakistani citizens out there, but I have zero respect for their military who are harbouring terrorists.  bhai ye sab to theek hai but biryani kaha hai? The Indian guy used a blue marker and the Pakistani guy used a green marker.
Coincidence?
I think not.
Hotel?
Trivago.  This is heartwarming and all but why are people spreading old pictures?  I don't hate Pakistan I hate terrorists We love peace even when our soldiers are killed by terrorist. Will we love it when our family member's really die from an terror attack? This is cute  He should've written it with orange ink I remember this one taken from the past. 


Sure, many Indians won't hold any vengeance if they met pakistanis in real life. 
Its their state sponsoring terrorism and constant denial which is pissing us off!!.  *""I am an NRI, I have not been to India in decades and don't plan on going there ever, I don't care about India, I just want some free social networking points""* Everyone is the same from inside  Modi and Imran Khan has left the chat. r/dubai I am an indian. My gaming buddy is from pakistan. Though i hate terrorist. Pakistan should put hold on to his terrorist activities. Thanks.  Well it's not about hating Pakistan, Its just about how tolerant we have been. Pakistanis are our brothers but that doesn't mean everything they do is justified. Anti-national!!!!!! /s

On a serous note, pictures like these should be circulated on Whatsapp, not BJP propaganda and #SayYesToWar. A thought experiment "" The Indian guys loses his family member in Pulwama attack"", the ""Pakistani guys defends the right of Kashmiri to attack"", how do you think this friendship will move forward ?  I dont know of any Indian who wants to be enemy of Pakistan for the sake of it, but because we keep getting reminders from Pakistan (Parliament attack, 26/11, Pulwama and countless others) , and hence we want a strong action. There #SayNoToWar hashtags are good but in practical life they serve no purpose. This is just dumb and stating what's the most obvious thing. I'm pretty sure most Americans didn't hate Japanese when US dropped nuclear bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Soviets didn't ""hate"" general American, common American people didn't hate Soviets either. 

India has made it very clear that they only target terrorist hubs in Pakistan. If Pakistan doesn't take adequate step to curb its state-sponsored terrorism, India has no option except raging war/doing multiple air-strike or escalating this issue. This has nothing to do with whether general Indians like Pakistanis or vice-versa. 
 Don't hate.. till it's a cricket match. Hope the IAF and PAF commanders also do something similar.  Man, the English really fucked us up geopolitically.  Why these comments look like they are more from Pakistani chutyas then Indians 

Kill your terrorist Pakistan or we will kill pakistan  The fact of the matter is civilians are not at India's target its the terrorist which are given safe heaven on Pakistan's  Land  The only impending issue between the two nations is Kashmir. Solve Kashmir and everything else is solved but the thing is once they solve Kashmir there'd be nothing else to present to their domestic audience. Well here in France, we go to Pakistani food joints because they serve the best 'Indian food' @Nord @BombayPalace that too for 5€ I'm an Indian in Dubai too. My boss is a Pakistani. He is a great mentor but my team hasn't met sales targets for the month of Feb. Meeting on Sunday.


;-;

 Many of the right leaning proud nation loving youth of this country want war though. How dare they capture one of our pilots? How dare they mock us by playing the ""good guy"". We want revenge. We want to show to the rest of the world, we have a bigger dick.

 People don't each others, politicians hate each other and use peoples Problem is with ISI and Pakistani government not taking against terrorists. Indians don’t have hatred for regular Pakistanis. Don't spread BS.

It was never about general public but between Pakistani terrorist, their military, their govt who attacked at India.

India is just retaliating.  It's not India vs Pakistan. It's India vs Terrorism. Some people are dumb enough to think that war will be good for anyone and will solve terrorism  Well. I am an Indian, from India and I have great Pakistani friends too. 

We always seem to forget the problem is the govt vs their govt (policies, decisions and indecisions)...

and not people vs people. Say no to war. We are common people and we want peace. Everyone knows the cost of a war.  Common people all want peace and friendship, it's the politicians who have made a mess. They stared it.There will be no war.Pakistan us in crippling debt.zit cannot sustain a war for more than 5 days Not all Indians are rioters/gaurakshaks. Not all Pakistanis are extremists/jem operatives. We don't hate Pakistanis rather I hate Indian Muslims who support terrorism and proxy war by Pakistan and support attack on Indian army. War against terrorist not Pakistan.
 Our  enemy is not pakistan or china ,  Main enemies are corrupt leaders, robber who rob crores of rupees like maliya and nirav modi and lalit modi , also those which killed hundreds due to posionous liquor and duplicate medicine..

Our enemies is cause of jobless and suicides of many farmers  I also lived for almost 2 years in Abu Dhabi and this was my case too. My best friends were too sikhs, and two from malayalam area.Even the senior to me who was from Rajhistan area was a very cool guy.Even though i lived with 3 other Pakistanis but most of my time was with those guys there.

Thanks for sharing. Now buttfuck each other If only this was what it took to stop a war.  I wish it had also said #SayNoToTerrorism too That’s what. If only people living in the respective countries realised that. Smh! 🤦🏻‍♂️ Sounds great,
But that's not how it works....

https://www.reddit.com/r/indianews/comments/avrdfh/today_as_abhinandan_is_about_to_return_i_remember/?utm_source=reddit-android The people aren't the problem it's the leaders that want power I'm an Indian who was born in America. Some of my friends are Pakistani, and we barely even think about it. On one side, Terror State Pakistan is asking for so called peace and on other side they are still doung ceasefire violations. Why would any Indian believe in such a nation which is well known for stabbing in the back for last 70 years? No way !

Its high time that Indian Army should go for Final Strike. Seperate Balochistan, Sindh and PoK from Terror harbouring nation Pakistan ! Lynching in 3....2...1 /s With all due respect are they ready to stand like this on the LOC and not expect to get shot bu the either side ? 

With all due respect would Mumbai attacks have been stopped if theese guys would have stood on the Central station holding these childish signs ? 
 I'm an Indian and friendship is one of the greatest religion. [deleted] [deleted] Speaking about peace while fostering terrorists. who started first ? definitely not india Friends sending terrorists to other friend's house...not good! This is wholesome. But they could work on their handwriting tho. 

 पैसे वालो का वैसे भी कोई धर्म या देश नही होता War is awful India needs to reply with an attack, am sorry but it should happen once not against people but the one who injured us... we love, all together.. War to wse hi ni hga I too am an advocate of peace and friendship. It bothers me the way citizens are garnering hate towards either countries. The citizens of Pakistan and India had nothing to do with the attacks. In an attempt to raise awareness, I wrote this article today and this post was a major driving force behind it.

Okay Inhale love, exhale hate. Wish you all a happy Yoga day.

*Yoga is Islamic confirmed* doing better yoga than Mudi ji .......... Adorable trained pets [deleted] first one is inspired from modi . looking at camera Even Dogs are not spared!! “Second to none”, well apparently second to the 1 Army Dog Unit The postures are designed for human beings. Why would you make dogs perform such atrocities? 

It doesn't help them, and as harmless as it might be, I don't think this should be encouraged. Hard to tell where the cuteness ends and senseless stupidity takes over. This is not funny.

"A mother wrote to Hindustan pencils about her left-handed daughter's needs and they responded  Apsara and Nataraj..?? By the same company..??

I've been living a lie.  Think about this for a second. Someone took the time to write to a large corporation. Then, that large corporation actually read the letter. After which, RnD was told to create these sharpers for a left-handed person. Along with all of these. They sent a letter back telling the mother they are working on this issue.  An Indian company with such customer service , quite unheard of. TIL about Left-hand pencil sharpners.
 A hand signed letter, a real noble gesture indeed. Someone post this to /r/upliftingnews Sanjay Tiwari is the man! He is the Group Marketing Manager, so good job! the hardships of being left handed in a majoritarian right handed society brings back childhood memories   Great gesture by the company.

OT: 
As a left hander, I cannot stress enough of how difficult it is to be left handed in a right handed world. In my own experience, as a kid my teachers would often hit me on my hand saying ""use the proper hand"", being a defiant cunt I wouldn't cave in. But I wonder how many people prefer the left hand but were forced to become right handed. Same goes for all that religious shit the pandits do and then say ""seedha haat se karo"". 

 [TIL More than 2,500 left-handed people are killed every year from using equipment meant for right-handed people.](https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/269f1e/til_more_than_2500_lefthanded_people_are_killed/) [deleted] Uh, how is left handed sharpeners different from normal/right handed sharpeners? Is being left-handed a disability? As a lefty myself I have never had an issue sharpening pencils. Now using scissors is a whole other issue.  [deleted] Can someone ELI5 why a left handed person can't use a normal pencil sharpener? Wait, what's hard about twisting the pencil in the opposite direction? Either direction takes about 10 seconds maybe once a day.  I don't really see how a pencil sharpner is hand based?



Like really do it the way w/ the right hand or do it with the left hand just with opposite rotations 







or is she the first left hand user in the entire nation in the entire history having to sharpen a pencil for the first time being left handed...





Not like to rant or thing but writing a letter for this seems either a 'test' done by some news agency or the parent is really overexaggerating. They said 5 units. Am I the only one who is mildly infuriated here ? 160 comments and no one actually explained why lefties need their own sharpeners.  I never thought there's a 'right' way to sharpen a pencil. You just stick it and rotate it towards the blade, how hard can it be? It's not rocket science, what's the issue in rotating a pencil?  Err if I'm dumb here let me know but aren't pencil sharpeners able to be used with either hand? Like, you just stick the pencil in and crank it... The one I have at my house is just a square. In what way  do left handed people face problem when writing with normal pencils?Can someone enlighten me? Now we just need a company to make left handed condoms! As a lefty this has never been problem. Awesome thing of the to do, yada yada but can we back up a minute?

Have pencil sharpeners always been a left/right handed thing?? It has my life been a lie Ohhh I see. I tried to read the article but seeing as it’s clickbait I can’t hahahahaha  Can’t twist it the other way? TIL my left handedness qualifies me as special needs.  Didn't know lefties need special sharpeners. I do not want to question their intent but is it possible that they did it just so that someone would post this on social media and it would go vial? like /r/Random_entropy said ""An Indian company with such customer service , quite unheard of."" This is awesome! Hope they get all the good PR they deserve from this. How is a left hand sharpener different from a right hand sharpener?

Can't a left handed person just use a right hand sharpener by turning the pencil in the opposite direction? Tiwari ji, sab samajh riye hai hum. Just use a mechanical pencil. I hate being left handed, like trying to have hobbies is extremely hard (depending on which one) It makes me happy not because I'm left handed but because that response was unexpected Finally has a crusader arrived for my kind!  I count 3 sharpeners. Can't they make sharpeners that are gripped conveniently from either side? So soon we will get left-handed sharpeners in markets. Really left-handed peoples will feel happy. Thanks for the hindustan pencils.  We are waiting for an update on that kid's score in the next test Excellent. Such a positive post, such a shit storm in the comments. Please change, randia. I am feeling very glad after reading this post as I am left handed person. This is very appreciable that you guys have done great job and you have open your wide vision for marketing through such types of product. I agree that the company was awesome in helping the little girl out but of all the things that left-handed people suffer dealing with, pencil sharpeners would be at the very bottom of the list. Am I wrong? This is amazing, even if it is deplorable that this exchange did not take place in an Indian language. They took the effort to make an industrial-quality version especially for left-handed people. This guy and Hindustan pencils now has my respect. ""Should have asked the mother to fuck off"" - Steve Jobs  I still use my 7 or 8 year old Nataraj sharpeners occasionally! They're so good.  Nataraj phir champion Now if only right handed chairs could be removed...  that nice This is nice but why your reddit username is jungle wahi banayege? 😂😂😂 Bombay - 001 pincode FTW.

 Wholesome, however that's some real dedication to sharpening pencils since when did pencil sharpeners become dominant hand dependent? i have never seen an asymmetrical sharpener before.

and what mind boggling ""R&D"" did the company do to just reflect the shape of the sharpener? Thanks to the so caring parents, one of my two children is left handed, but I neither ever thought about it nor he ever expressed any special need. My both children grew up naturally without any discrimination. Still today both are equally competent. I never experienced left handedness need any special attention. 
Any way you have opened a new market for the corporates.  Hmm. I have sinistrality too and this new sharpener will just fuck me up at this age. But it's good. :) Wow ! That's amazing ! I want one too :) /r/LeftHandProblems Respect sir I'm left handed but this makes me feel uncomfortable lol Sasta wala PR. I'm lefty and never had problem sharpening pencils Do you want a customer for life? Because that's how you get a customer for life!  I have to point out Natraj > Apsara

 And then people say all Indian companies suck at customer service That signature tho! Dope. Most dope indeed That signature. r/WholesomeCorporate Much respect to Hindustan Pencils for this! Dude's got a neat signature. Thats a rad signature The guy’s signature looks like a tank engine Dope signature. Angle up and right, makes me think he's not left handed. If so, that's cool that he's empathetic. [deleted] beautiful. This right here is some heartwarming stuff. Your post reached **top five in /r/all/rising**.

"The Trend is spreading to Dimapur, Nagaland.  I am from Nagaland! 🙋🏻‍♀️ This makes me so proud.  Proud of you kiddos !! Take a bow. Why do they look so cool even with trash  They look like a dope Indian version of a k pop band about to drop their debut EP. 

Congratulations and thank you for helping to make our country and our earth a more beautiful place!  This is awesome. This is one challenge every citizen should take.

Also, why do they look so cool? God! Northeast showing India the way. Dimapur really needs it though. The roads in nagaland are atrocious!  This is not related to the post, or isn't racist on my part. But I think north eastern Indians have a great clothing sense. Like, you guys manage to look cool in literally anything _i’m so proud of this community_ /r/TrashTag. Our Northeast brothers and sis..ermm..girls have some amazing fashion sense. How do they manage to pull off looking cool in uniforms. Even Modern Barakhamba people look washed out in front of em. I am from Assam, and I am proud of Nagaland. Hope people in my state also learn some lessons from Nagaland. Great job! [removed] Why are north east Indians so beautiful?  Which Anime is this?


Jk. They are looking Hella cool.  Northeast Indians have the best sense of style in the whole of India

 This thing needs to trend in the north now How do you know which photo was taken first? Kids these days. Damn millennials picking up garbage and cleaning up the environment

/s The amount of swag in the photo is too damn high 🔥 I hope this trend spreads more that #Kiki or #10yearschallenge.  and 56 will hijack this as his achievement - you know swacch bharat and all Out of the loop, can anyone explain? Trash-kun samaaaa These images need some kind of time-stamp metadata These guys look like they are about to drop a pop album.. I wonder where all the #trashtag trash is actually going. The main flaw in our system is our poor recycling mechanism. We just have huge garbage mountains. Our Northeastern brethren look so stunning even in school uniforms.. Isn't this basically the swach Bharat challenge? Wow. Really proud of my country folks. I wish that the people who were responsible for throwing the garbage there and the people who are paid to do this were half as responsible. Kids taking up this responsibility would generate a lot of grassroots level awareness.
 This trend needs to get viral all over india What trend? Where did it start? Nicely done. We are proud of you 😍 slag level infinity  I surely absolutely 100%  love nagaland and it's people. When I see people from Northeast and their sense of style, I up vote. Wait. So this is a trend now? Or am I missing something... Amazing stuff !!!! Moments like these restore my faith in humanity  
\#ProudIndian North East folks are so fashionable This legit looks like something out of anime. Damn, they look like cool anime high school students_;_; DAMN!! JAI HIND  Thank go pro man  I like these challenges which is good for the society.  They look like the cool cast of any popular high-school manga! Kakko-ii! great 👍👍 gold for you guys  Who knew that posting online was enough reward  Lets keep it going until it’s a cultural thing. These kids look awesome. Glad that good etiquette is now a trend.

Tripura, Nagaland, Manipur....NE India gets no love! Nice to see youngsters investing their time and energy in something productive like cleaning up their neighborhood. Way to go...

I wonder if it will stay this way after all the effort. It is very unlikely that it will stay clean at least in most parts of India. Nagaland. Can you sort out Ahemedebad before I get back please.... One of the coolest uniform I've seen.  I guess I was there cleaning my neighbours garbage, which we do every 2 Saturday's of month. IIT: North East Indians looks so beautiful and fashionable. Good job, it should spread across the globe Subscribe to PewDiePie, un subscribe from T-series, bitch lasagna As an Indian, this makes me super proud. Is it close to china  Love it. I hope this trend goes on forever! I thought NE was relatively cleaner than rest of India. These kids are doing a good job! Also, I don't I will ever look that cool while cleaning trash. Modi where you at?  Great initiative...in general I have seen ppl from the NE region much much cleaner and hygienic. Not sure what is lacking with the other regions of India....but Kudos NE friends!! im shiftin to nagaland😍 Dont break the chain guys. Keep the fire burning

&#x200B; Why do they look like they are a K pop band even after collecting trash? 🤣😂😂 These people are clearly not India but south-east Asian  Nagaland? Where is this, China? Are they in high school?

There are still trials and challenges ahead. Decriminalizing is just the first step--for further rights to be secured by the LGBT community, a more fundamental change in opinions also needs to happen. This happened pretty quickly in the U.S.--in maybe a decade and a half, homosexuality went from being a huge negative to being a normal and accepted part of society, even among the most conservative parts of the country. I do hope the same happens here.

Again, congratulations, my Indian friends! 🇮🇳🏳️‍🌈🇺🇸 Today is 6th Sep, truly 69 indeed. Pun intended! So I told my colleagues about section 377 and they didn't knew about it. This girl said why are you so happy.  The other girl said he is happy for his own kind.  I was so angry.   It took a long damn time, but here we are. The government and the law enforcement can no longer interfere in what happens between two consenting adults. Love wins. :) There has been a lot of negative news regarding this country. This shines as a ray of hope that our courts can work separately over its citizens inspite of pressure from powerful religious bodies. Well done, SC.  Remember, Remember, the 6th of September !!! Well, about damn time and celebration day for the LGBTQ community. And the law enforcement can stop targeted harassment towards LGBT individuals.   
This is truly a positive news.    
Cheers to progress!  About. Bloody. Time. Pro tip: someone X-post this on r/UpliftingNews for easy karma.  
(I would've, but I'm too lazy) This is great news! For some reason I've always thought that in my lifetime I would never get to see this happen but it is happening. Cheers! “Majoritarian views and popular morality cannot dictate constitutional rights. We have to vanquish prejudice, embrace inclusion and ensure equal rights.”

This is so heartening to read. :) All is not lost. I am soo happy that I want to yell ""fuck yeah"" to all those bastards in my office who hates the Gay community.  And we finally enter the 21st Century in the societal sense. Finally! Good. Now make same sex marriage legal. It is a logical follow up. Actually we need to call out people when they make homophobic remarks. We got the legal acceptance now and we had our awesome activists to fight this battle for us. Next is the social acceptance and we need each and everyone of us to do our bit l, it could be as little as calling out people and telling them they are homophobic. 

All in all, I am happy for my community. I was in the office when I got to know about the verdict, had to go to the restroom to cry since I was not able to handle my emotions. Thanks SC, you changed a lot of lives today.  Anyone who opposes the sec377 verdict should go to Pakistan.

&#x200B;

You see what I did there :) Just wanted to say the whole of Section 377 is not struck down. 377 also criminalize things like beastiality. Tu Khuda hai, na mera ishq farishton jaisa  
Dono insaan hai, to kyu itne hijaabon mein milein  
**--Ahmad Faraz**


shitty translation

Neither are you God, nor is my love like that of angels  
If we both are mere mortals, why should we meet in such secrecy Great news ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ In April 2014, SCI declared transgender to be the 'third gender' in Indian law and Now today, this decision..Kudos to SCI  
Change is slow but it's better than nothing..Future is bright but the path to future is tough All hail the lord Dipak Misra. This is so great! Alexa play Hogi pyaar ki Jeet! India still has a long way to go in fully accepting homosexuality in society, but until then, we have this victory to cherish. 

Also, 

>  ""Majoritarian views and popular morality cannot dictate constitutional rights""- CJI Misra's judgment      

Don't want to be needlessly political here, but I wish the BJP takes a page out of this book.      

 India is one of the few countries that has decriminalized homosexuality and also recognizes transgender as a legal gender/ person. 
Feels real good saying this :) 

Now time to implement it, and yes! Legalize gay marriage!  Holy fckin shit! This really happened? I was keeping my expectations low. Some respite for the marginalized, finally.  [deleted] Woohoo!!!! Way to go with equal rights!  Well done, Supremes. Well done, indeed. 

https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/verdict-on-section-377-and-gay-rights-live-updates/article24878751.ece Many Indians and south Asians will be disappointed today. Look at the YouTube comments. The real work is left, to educated those uneducated. They are thinking that ""This is the last nail in the coffin of Indian civilisation"", little do they know that homosexuality is documented in Sutras. As a straight guy with a happy married life I cannot express how glad I am this is happening. Consent should not be criminalized ever and I’m glad there are at least some judges who see it that way.  Awesome, now I can finally suck my homies off!  My cousin has been fighting in this front for so many years. I'm so happy for all of us and to see that his hard work paid off!!! I guess all those Christian cultist organizations will be pretty pissed now.

>https://thewire.in/lgbtqia/at-supreme-court-all-three-religious-groups-backing-section-377-are-christian/amp/ When I see these kind of verdicts by the Supreme Court of my country, it makes me hopeful and relieved that there is still power in the right hands when it comes to Judiciary. All hope is gone when it comes to governance but the Judiciary is still trying to help the people breathe.

Congratualations to the people who have lived in fear. Congratulations to the common man who supported this ideology too. Hope this is the first step in a wave of progressive decisions.
 [Full judgement](https://www.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2016/14961/14961_2016_Judgement_06-Sep-2018.pdf) Is it true that oral and anal sex are also criminalised there? Hot damn! Now I can finally eat ass without feeling like a criminal.  It will be socially acceptable in india when arranged gay marriages start happening.

Rajeev Chandrashekhar (BJP): #SupremeCourt decriminalises #Homosexuality ! 

SC ruled a year ago (I was petitioner) that #PrivacyIsAFundamentalRight n tdy extended tht right to personal sexual choices for #LGBT community 👍🏻 “I am what I am. So take me as I am” https://twitter.com/rajeev_mp/status/1037662740599500801 The bigger implication is that blowjobs are now legal too. Hallelujah!

Edit: for the downvoters, gay people enjoy blowjobs too you know. This objectively impacts more people. /s [This comment should be big.](https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/1037597682657898496?s=20)

It sets a precedent. Maybe now workplace discrimination and whole lot of other issues can be challenged in court. This opens a pandora box. Even central government could be taken to court maybe. Next step: legalising same sex marriage... Firstly, good on the supreme court for squashing a very medievalistic law and choosing to do the right thing. I am genuinely happy for the LGBT community.

Having said that, I seriously doubt this will change much on the ground, realistically. The actual problem is the people's mindset. I mean, in a country where consenting straight couples are morally policed or harassed, I doubt this will actually change how people look at the LGBT community. Now, people will find other ways (probably more dangerous and possibly fatal ways) to deal with members of the LGBT community since the law can't do anything about something they feel is not correct or something that offends them. The problem has always been the people is what I feel.

I am straight and I never had issues with anyone's sexual orientation. Most of the people I know, never had issues with LGBT folks either because we more or less follow a live-and-let-live stream of thought and don't get upset over things that are different from the perspective we hold, but in our country, we are pretty much a minority. I think it's the average Indian family that should try and change their attitude towards this issue (and many other societal issues our country faces). Only then will there be real progress.

Again, I am glad things are changing. I know its a slow process. I am pretty sure that a decade or two ago, even coming out as gay would have been a monumental task and look where we are now. Hopefully, things will get better ahead and the people, in general, will change their mindset and just be a little more open about things. Deepak Mishra came out in support of decriminalization. I live in opposite world today.  Now comes the hard part: Getting society to fully accept the LGBT+ community.  Ah, this is the 377^th comment in this thread :) Next up, marriage equality.

But honestly it's going to take much more than a SC ruling to make gay sex socially acceptable. Heck, sex by itself is still a taboo before marriage. What a wonderful day! A tad too late, but finally we have it. I was wondering when this was going to happen. Way to go! Finally some good news. :) Good now make marijuana legal. MERA BHARAT MAHAN! 

:) Enjoy your legal gay sex, Indians! Now legalise weed :3 So proud of you guys, love from France ^^ I heard somewhere that folks are planning to file a new petition once the Chief Justice changes - is this possible? It's quite scary if true. A small step towards liberalism. Many more stupid and irrational laws(like some of the hate speech laws) in our constitution hopefully will be scrapped soon as well. Awesome. India's taking the right steps. Finally its legal, and hopefully public opinion will change for the better and soon calling someone 'gay' as an insult will come to an end This is brilliant.  That's progressive.  Can somebody ask [this unkil](https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/society/it-is-like-reversing-the-motion-of-the-earth/article5483306.ece) how it's hanging after today's verdict? Great decision.  Ache din Aa'Gay'e! Are Sex Toys also legal now? Very happy that consensual gay sex has been legalized. One more step in the right direction towards equal rights. I hope the SC would legalize gay marriage already!!  High time this got passed. A more fundamental change needs to happen in the mentality of older generations who have perhaps not had as much of an encounter with homosexuality in a personal or more casual way. Keep in mind the stigma of homosexuality can be almost as bad as the illegality of it  https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/section-377-pride-not-extended-to-jk/articleshow/65714300.cms Well only half of the battle has been won. We still have to legalize homosexual marriage and relive it from being a public taboo.  This is really a good decision. every one should have an equal right to choose their partner without any discrimination.  kudos to the justice system of India.. great job I’m not that smart. Does Decriminalise means they get to get married as well? Like in the states, get married and have kids?  Now if you could just work on that rape thing. What's gonna be fun now is how all the gay celebs can openly admit.  Acche din for the LGBT community has finally come.

P.S: This is not a politically motivated comment. I know Modi has nothing to do with this. Just Saying... Nacho bc Very necessary step in a long path. A very late one too but happy for the decision all the same.  Great move. Time to be more open minded and think about the future :) I am happy that I am observing this much important verdict from SC, let's hope society embrace this thing too... With an open mind.  Finally proud of the Supreme court  That is such a good thing to here. Now time to normalise LGBTQ community in India because most older people I know are against LGBTQ community, and it will be hard to live like that.  great to see the design of r/india denoting that - nice work admins Yes. And here's a Message for the Conservative Indians who still think it's a problem to our Society.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjDSZUpFxek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjDSZUpFxek) This is awesome news!! Good days are seriously coming in India.  Great news  At this day and age ,any sort of discrimination in a democratic country should be condemned. A momentous day for the lgbtqp community and congratulations. The Supreme Court is the one thing in this country that remains a bastion of hope against the chaotically retarded fuckfest that is Indian politics.
This is good news. Acche din aa gaye :) Nice; how was this enforced in the slightest before this? Yay! Congratulations! Although it's still a pain in the ass for society to accept it. Long way to go but still... Progress is progress! Days like these are what makes you proud about India, but it is also days like these where it is just so sad to see the 2 sides on India. One is the comments section here where people are cheering, the other is the comments section here:

TOI is one of the largest media house in India and just look at the comments on this thread, it is shameful to say the least. Wow this was unexpected (was it?) Congratulations you guys! Very proud of you :) And pretty damn good statement too, this is only a beginning, I know it will be many years or decades before social acceptance happens. So who wants to celebrate punishment free  non vaginal sex To put this in perspective, today every 10th Indian got the right to choose their partner.  r/suddenlygay and that's fucking awesome  Still waiting I don't know when they remove caste system from India.  Progress FTW Don't sort by controversial. It's still cancerous. Let's celebrate the Supreme court's landmark verdict about 377 section of Indian penal code headed by Chief Justice of India Dipak Mishra and 4 other judges. Scrap the 377 law and finally long battle of many NGO's and LGBTQ finished today. is anal sex legal too? As a side effect blow jobs are now legal. Toh aajao bhai log. Let's have some fun.  Someone tell Scott Adams....
http://dilbert.com/strip/2014-02-07 This is amazing news. Congratulations you guys! Much love from Palestine! WOOT We have accomplished half the goal by decriminalizing it.

Now just the other half of removing the *stigma* associated with it   ""send dik and bobs pls"" Now loda chuus will be a suggestion rather than being offensive Time to fuck https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/government-has-no-space-in-bedrooms-shashi-tharoor/articleshow/65700657.cms

Government has no space in bedrooms: Shashi Tharoor

 And it's CJI Mishra, who was accused of being a BJP's puppet. Lol.  It's really sad that something such as this is still news that we hope for; the fact it was ever considered criminal activity just riles me up so much. It sucks that the LGBTQI+ community get the short end of the stick and are omitted from 'Human Rights.' I hope this is the start of what will be equality for all and a country that actually embrace human rights! Big heartfelt love go out to the LGBTQI+ community over there! 😘❤️❤️ Commenting to be part of history. I welcome this move. Here's hoping people celebrate it by distributing sweets. Free Laddoos for all. 

Edit: am hungry. Indian society traditionally does not recognize such relations: Arun Kumar

Kumar claimed that Indian society ""traditionally does not recognize"" such relations. Humans usually learn from experiences, so this topic needs to be discussed and handled at the social and psychological level, he added. Congrats people.  Very small step towards, hopefully a better India.  I’ve always wanted to travel to India for gay sex and now I can! Yay The banner of sub looks nice This is gay.  Stick it in his butt!!! Congratulations, India. Proud of you. This make me proud to be of indian heritage.  While I hail the SCoI for this decision and I am very happy that this nonsensical idiotic arhaic rule has been scrapped, please realise that the battle for our LGBT brethren is far from over. This act still does not permit Gay marriage, inheritence or adoption.

For that an amendment might be needed in the Marriage Act. Even if cases were filed in the SC regarding it, SC could give derivative decisions but an actual amendment is needed to provide full rights to the LGBT community.

Also, let me just mention, the mentality of a lot of people needs adjusting. That, probably is the biggest battle of all. That took a while  🌈Great🏳️‍🌈 Now, We can see, Indian culture is changing according to world. We should accept challenges which is happening across the world. New law is a chain of new and modern India.  Well done Supreme Court.   
You have finally got the government out of our bedroom.   
Now, for the kitchen.  VALIDATIONNNN!!! YEEEAAHHH!! This is the second time this is happening. Also, marriage still not recognised. No need to get so happy folks. The situation is still bad.

"Beautiful Bangalore  Great composition, but too much HDR. so pretty! which area is this? And what flowers are those (look like cherry blossoms). 

 These trees are all over Bangalore. Look really pretty imo. Stop posting such awesome pics to the internet! The world will be at Bangalore's door and we are already at choking point!     

Jokes aside, awesome pic! Come on! No way that photo has not been processed after getting clicked! Bangalore at this time of the year turns seriously beautiful with its flowering trees. [This](https://imgur.com/a/vTMUP) was shot near my home few days back. Is that bumper a normal thing? The color saturation in this picture cured my depression. r/shittyHDR What flowers are those? We have some lovely flowering trees that can be grown in our cities but we just don't care about nature as yet. For example in the hot climate in Delhi - palash, gulmohar, jacaranda, boganvilla, kachnar, amaltaas all bloom around the begining of summer. Palash is blooming in Delhi right now and its insanely beautiful. Wish we would plant more such trees. 

They create a mess for sure but that just one month of bloom makes up for the whole year's mess.  NGV! Yes, it does look this pretty. I’ve seen it for a couple of years now around the same time. :)

Really beautiful picture! From Kundanhalligate to CMRIT continuous these pink tree   Looks great! I would appreciate if you share the unprocessed version of this even if it has just 10% of the colors. Are the trees similar to the cherry blossoms which are there in Japan ? I remember seeing similar trees in Germany and was told these are Japanese cherry blossom. Also the streets near Jayanagar 4th block shopping complex are very colorful with similar trees. Until 2000s, the beginning stretch of BEL road from sadashivnagar police station to MS Ramaiah hospital used to be mind blowing.  Not anymore with excessive traffic.  What place is this? My university campus has those trees too, and the place was mesmerizing, heavenly here. And then we had rains day before yesterday, which misted up the atmosphere. Thing was surreal. The no. of morons complaining about Bangalore > no. of people appreciating this post.

To those morons, create a new thread to complain about Bangalore than hijacking someone's post related to different topic. Are those Sakura trees? National Games Village? Guessing from the cars parked in lane on either sides.  hey, NGV! (I live there) Will you please post the unedited version? overexposed and HDR Minus the pollution cloud Hyundai is clearly leading this shot.
 If this picture can be so pretty, would love to see how Cubbon Park or Lalbagh Botanical Gardens would look..  You wake up and decide to take a morning walk, something like this would amplify the positivity by a factor of 10. N.G,V? It is surely a really beautiful place. 500 mts away from my old home, used to walk every morning, come back in the afternoon and go to tuitions in the evening and come back at night. I also used to play football in that field. One of the most beautiful places in Bangalore. Despite the heat, these trees make me so fucking happy. Thank you for this picture. The city of Gulmohar trees once upon a time.. nice post processing.  Where's this place?  I like it even with HDR. good ISO Aaaaand this makes me sad. Bangalore could have been a world class city with a climate like no other. But we HAD to fuck it up. Been ages since I've witnessed clear skies in India.  r/shittyhdr HDR ki ma behen kar di bhai  [deleted] Award for most post processing goes to  HDR bohot jyada lagta hai bhai but good effort! Bc hdr itna ki cgi rendered image lag rahi. Great pic thou the overblown HDR makes it look cartoonish  It would more beautiful, if all those cars didn't exist and if the road was free.  Shot in a traffic jam. How much more Bangalore can you get? Looks like Shillong Who needs to go to Japan when you can get the cherry blossom experience in Bangalore:) Is this from koramangala? I was there today morning...lol Is this NGV? xD coz I stay very close to this place and it looks very similar. good work That's NGV right  Oh yes. It's March.  Are those Japanese Maples? (Or Tulip tree depending on where you’re from)

Regardless, beautiful trees.  Fuck the haters. I think it looks awesome.

I photographer is not a photographer if they don't post process. Can OP post the image without the processing?? Found this on Facebook
https://imgur.com/gallery/2gQA9 HDR is overdone that the sky and birds look fake to me, considering how I have barely ever seen proper blue sky (and I know what I am talking about since I have been to rural parts of India with less pollution and outside of India where the sky is actually blue without clouds) 

but I like the fallen flowers and the green of trees (looks less dirty than they are in real life)  Oh come on... Nose-in-ass traffic and foamy lakes that catch fire is the real Bangalore. This is what 0.00000001% of Bangalore (when seen through a favorable angle) looks like. The rest is all a dumpster. Bangalore. Before and After Filters.  👍 Beauty outdone by the cars.. Bangalore has become chaotic The benefits of a traffic jam Are the skies really that blue in Bangalore? Over-processed photoshop hell.  Ofcourse too much of HDR and obviously highly processed,  but represents true bangalore.  ""Cars everywhere and no place to conviniently cross the road "" Been to Bangalore. This is false.  This is NGV Koramangla. The OP has done suck fuckery with the photo. In reality its not beautiful. Really? Doesn't look like real. [deleted] Memoirs of a Traffic Jam.

Also, speakers with low bass and high treble fitted directly from the factory to play your favorite Punjabi song. that doesn't look bad at all!! there's a charm when it comes to trucks in India. It's one of those things that i would miss if it goes away.. Honestly, I don't see anything bad with this, it's known as culture and is something to feel proud about.

"This is Ramesh from Dharmapuri, He donated 5 baskets of guava when he saw the collection drive in Bangalore. This was everything he was planning to sell this evening. [x-post r/Kerala]  may life return his charity ten fold  Well, OP you now know where to buy your guavas for THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, I guess ! I took this photo when we were (we still are) collecting relief materials at Vignanagar, Kaggadaspura, Bangalore - Near Poorvika mobiles. I went to buy few guavas, and he enquired about the crowd. When I told him this is for the flood relief, he grabbed a few carton boxes and filled with all the fruits he had. Knowing that it will seriously affect his earning, I tried to stop him. Then he said 'Panam naleikku venalum sambadhikkalam' (I can make money tomorrow too).  I couldn't say a word. I managed to click the photo, but stupid me forgot to ask his contact details. 
Let me see if he comes in the same street today as well. If not I will personally check with the shopkeepers nearby and try to get in touch with him. Where in Bangalore? I would like to buy guavas from him.  As a Keralite, thank you is all I have to say. r/HumansBeingBros Respect ! Salute to you sir !  He must've slept like a baby, with heart so content ..

God bless this man. Off topic; I see (educated)customers arguing with people who sell fruits and vegetables on the road side, but pay more in super markets and malls without blinking an eye. I was doing the same thing before I realised that they work really hard to earn very very little income. I think we should all stop doing this.  This is called actual humanity.shame on those people who have lots of money but never have a big heart to donate something.

Well, I hope to at least emulate him someday. That's the very least I can do, I think. Charity really begins at home. I can praise him with tharoorite vocab, but then, for deeds so great, words fall short.

Edit : doesn't mean as a guava seller, the thing I mean is, to practice deeds like this. God will bless him 10 times.  It is greater than few lakhs donated by filthy rich people.  Kudos We need more people like him. Salute to you sir hats off to him🙏👍👌✌💜 Making India Proud....I salute you sir People like him are unsung Heroes of India. People like him are unsung Heroes of Our Country who don’t do this for any fame or money. They just help others for Humanity. I Salute people like him. I wish upvotes were money,we could give it to him. What a hero. I hope he gets a good job or does well in his current one. 

Such a generous soul. Thanks! Yaa it's all abt their own decision.I just tell this for the reason is that rich people see this post and they also heart so they learn something from all this.if they are willing to donate then it's ok if not then also ok.

Edit-Thanks to u/asseesh I know now that the max limit for donations is Rs10k I thought Paytm's founder was trolling Sorry!!! This is just dumb. Guava perishes within a week. Also transportation in Kerala is not at its best. Assuming the collection drive will last for atleast two days, there is no ways the fruits are reaching the people they are supposed to.

The problem is not that the food relief is not being sent by the govt rather it's the delivery of supplies. Roads, rail lines, runways are submerged.

"Spotify after two songs  Real-life lol’d. Lol really good one mate! I use modded on phone. No ads. Akshay Kumar Schemeposting I'm just using Amazon music these days. Comes with Prime which most people are already paying for. **Me, being broke but buying American Spotify:** Is this a peasant joke I am too rich to understand Damn. 😂 Use Youtube music , no ads and all the songs in existence available at good quality Kya India mein koi student discount nahin hai? Amreeka mein hamaare discount aadha hai. Haha, have my upvote. That girl rapping makes me wanna kill myself. Worst rap I've ever heard and it's not even close I like spottify and can handle the ads cus they have an amazing selection of metal music that's hard to find anywhere else u/titletoimagebot At present only thing I like about spotify is their discover weekly playlist. I've been able to find so many new songs through this playlist. Their remote control feature is also sometimes useful. Just pay for Amazon prime music , has almost every Hindi or English song  you can listen offline too and you get prime video and one day delivery too Been using the moded apk for 1.5 years now. No ads, nothing.

ZUUU!! If ur a student, it's really cheap I cannot stress this enough. Buy premium. Worth the purchase. Just around Rs. 100 Tej bhai ekdum tej u/Title2ImageBot This is hilarious! But in all honesty, its sad to see the comment section. So many of you don't want to pay for such an excellent service. Thode standards badha lo yaar apne, save money and spend on services which are worthy. Sigh. Spotify: haan chilla chilla k sabko scheme bata de, haramkhor. LMAO, why am i so poor! Is this some sort of a peasant joke template honestly i cant seem to figure out spotify android app !? 
how do you loop a song?
how do you see the queue ? is there a queue?
 why does it play random songs when i clearly selected my playlist ? lolmlol Hahah IRL I need more hera pheri memes, MORE! Just use modded YouTube music. it’s awesome YouTube music stomps Spotify into the ground Spotify hazaar Ka chutta maangte phirta kya ? US resident here- how much is a Spotify membership in India? It’s $10 a month, or $5 for students here It's available on PlayStation now!!! Rofl soo relatable the struggle is real. Best. Template. Ever. Spotify ads are just them telling you to buy the premium so you won’t have to listen to spotify ads. Saavn , same VPN be like: 

https://m.imgur.com/gallery/ClH0qf4 Just buy premium The songs I listen to are so old Prime Music is enough for me. Never even needed spotify. 😂😂😂 https://uploadrar.com/zgp4bglajy3r Genuine.laugh Haha on point! Apple Music is best Just delete the app and microwave your phone, you will be fine for another 2 songs Use the Spotify Mega-Mod. I'm student Premium member😁😁😁 Spotify ads are the most annoying ever because they're literally trying to get me to pay them to stop interrupting me on their own app,  if  that makes sense. Maybe use SoundCloud I love Spotify, way better than Apple Music. But the only reason I am not going for the paid service is that it lacks a family plan. Why are Indian consumers so stingy? Lol Spotify India is also not worth for a premium membership. Their collection is poor. No songs by led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd etc are available. Not even old songs by Kishore Kumar, Mukesh etc are available. Either wait for them to resolve their copyright issue or just use YouTube music. Chutiya app hai. I don't know why everyone raves about it. The recommendations are shit and its catalog is classics is shockingly empty jokes on you, i already paid for it.

but given that i listen to my spotify playlists atleast 3-4 times a day, its worth it What about Gaana or Saavn? Akshay Kumar memes are the best I am thinking of switching to gaana app its 160₹ for a whole year after applying student discount. Use JioSaavn. Works as a great alternative. JioSaavn is decent too Non music lover here, has the Spotify craze died down in India? I see fewer posts these days. Lmao Happens every time lol Not if you have the mod apk 😉 Use YMusic XDA to stream youtube videos as songs. Lmao..Need more of these Raju memes For Android what is the premium version any links. /u/TitleToImageBot I went back to Amazon music. The compensate for their not so good UI with a large music catalog.

Spotify doesn't have all songs I listen too. Like Marina, Sara Bareilles. They better sort out music licensing in India. Ok so memes and funny posts are allowed here then why were my posts deleted.   


Was it because the few people didn't like them. 

Or was it coz someone didn't like the political sarcasm. Then buy the fucking subscription 😁 support the artist you like. Kill your old cheap Indian habit .

This episode aired just last week. That guy definitely had some guts What the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land 🤣 No wonder season 8 was so disappointing

Dave and dan were watching balveer and aladdin the entire time That is why GOT last season was shit. The trick arya used to kill white walker was pretty common and had been portrayed previously many times. The whole 6 six season was used to build a giant enigma, called white walkers, which was eventually destroyed by a very cliched trick. **Welcome to DARK SOULS MODAFAKA** Wdf is he even stabbing at!? let me tell you this will never be cool it was fucked up He .. stabbed a skeleton.

The skeleton vaporised, like after the Thanos snap.

Then, he flicked a drop of sweat off his forehead.

I guess enough internet for today They also copied that skeleton and moonlight scene from Pirates of the Caribbean lol. Yo OP, you have to post this on r/freefolk Holy fuck!!!! Post this on r/freefolk 😂🤣 I was going to post this. You beat me. Thanos( the way skeleton degenerates into dust) + arya combined. Time period of got is ancient, so arya did it first. Why tf is he stopping his right hand in the first place Why didn't he stab skeleton with his right hand? What was holding back his right hand from stabbing? Lmao they even did the Thanos snap dust... Vikram I don’t feel so good. Demon Souls 2 coming along really well Can someone confirm whether this came out before or after Game of Thrones?


On second thought, I don't care this is funny af anyway That must be the Tata Steel Dagger to be able to kill that skeleton. This is why I visit reddit. Thank you. Actually, India did back when it was still cool. Elder Scrolls 6 leaked gameplay footage This one makes no sense though compared to Arya. Night King had her neck and knife hand restrained. This one doesn’t have the knife restrained. Is that the skeleton from the OG Runescape cover? Lol Why are GoT fans even watching this crap after the disappointment of Season 8??

My 12 years old  cousin used to watch this show. I show this video to him and ask if this episode was aired recently? He confirmed it. So I downloaded the sony liv app and go through 3-4 recent episodes. The episode containing this scene was aired on 13th of June 2019. So it's clearly a bad copy of GoT.

"IAF Sources: 12 Mirage 2000 jets took part in the operation that dropped 1000 Kg bombs on terror camps across LOC, completely destroying it  Has Indian Air Force ever carried out such an operation across the LoC? This is pretty big. Apparently, Indian jets flew from Bareilly AFB, keeping a low profile. Dad heard them fly over Moradabad around 2 am last night. He remembers 1971 vividly, says it reminded him of that. Please tell me that Masood Fucking Azhar is dead. BOMB VOYAGE!!! The attack was not in camps in PoK but in Pakistan territory, so Huge if true.  [deleted] Is there a chance this could evolve into a full scale war? god I hope not >Major General AK Siwach tells NDTV: ""There is absolutely no question that India is now on the highest alert. The strikes have been very successful, and now we must stay guarded

Who is this guy? Does this amount to official confirmation? This is fucking bold move Striked 40kms inside PoK. Pak army Twitter says no casualty, as expected because it won't sound good that Indian planes flattened the terrorist camp with numerous terrorists dead. Is there a reason for using Mirage for this mission and not Su-30? Are they better at low altitude flying? I was hearing jets while I had to pee around 330am.  If Pakistanis really hate terrorists, they would not be protesting this. The photos shared by pak officials looks awkwardly fake. No rouble, only 1 small crater. Is that how an exploded bomb looks like? Many different versions of this story are coming up....

It would very bold if this is true though. Indian gov has not confirmed anything yet. What I don't get is, how can we say 200-300 people were killed? Like technically how is this counted?  What do we know for sure? IAF 12 jets went in Pakistan territory and dropped payload near Balakot. Rest is hearsay. Wait and watch and do not go hyperbolic. For Pak, this is a second offense and Imran has just won a fresh electorate. I am overwhelmed by this strike but it is important to see Pak's reaction. Those extra 100 companies in Kashmir are suddenly making sense. [deleted] Hope, we don't get pushed into a retaliatory cycle of continuous attacks by each side. Pakistan is a suicide nation, they bargain with a gun held against their own head. They have a tardy economy, seeking constant bailouts, we on the other hand are comparatively thriving. Definitely have more to lose with a war on our shoulder than them.  Hey Iran, your turn now. Great day to stay away from warmongering TV anchors who have the luxury of ""mAkInG sAcrIfIcEs fOr tHe nAtIoN"" from air-conditioned offices and studios in Kamala Mills, Mumbai and Film City, Noida.  Awesome move! I wish there were a way we could know its impact though.

India Today claiming 200+ terrorists killed. But they also say that Pakistan inviting local and foreign journalists to the bomb site to say ""nothing happened"".

Takeaways: 
1 - Even without stealth fighters, it seems Indian jets can easily penetrate Pakistani airspace and return even in a high-alert situation. It's not like they would've been unprepared. Perhaps they flew low or they outran enemy air defense. No reports say SAM missiles were fired. So this is pretty inspiring.

2- As with the Surgical Strikes, it looks like we as civilians can never really know the effects of these strikes, given that all sources are partisan sources and truth is the first casualty of war. 

3- If this succeeds, ie, if we get away with nothing more than Pakistani shelling on the LOC, India can add one more option to its capability the next time there is a terror attack. Air strikes can grow indiscriminate and deadly enough that we create a genuine atmosphere of terror in Pakistan/PoK. Airstrikes could become far more effective and deeper in Pak territory once we add a stealth bomber to the arsenal.

4 - Terror ""launch pads"" is a weird concept and I wonder whether they will simply be moved away from the border for future purposes. I suppose this must have happened after the surgical strikes as well.

5 - [Edit] Looks like it's [45 km into PoK](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Tangdhar/Balakot,+Mansehra,+Khyber+Pakhtunkhwa,+Pakistan/@34.4678298,73.3148862,9.88z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x38e0eca18864d027:0x7454ea9d19e8ac97!2m2!1d73.860665!2d34.3974511!1m5!1m1!1s0x38de1b7589990827:0xe7dd67a8808f722a!2m2!1d73.3531852!2d34.5481523!3e0).

Pak media is saying that IAF ko hamne bhaga Diya lekin bokhlahat men unhone payload gira Diya  .....ha ha ha ... bokhlahat me tumhare Gand mar di If it's so deep into Pakistan territory, wouldn't cruise missiles be a more risk free option for such an exercise? Or is the doctrine that air strikes involve human personnel and risk of losing them, so it shows more commitment? Genuinely curious.  From Twitter

>Sadanand Dhume @dhume

>What we know: 1. The Pakistan army regularly lies through its teeth.  (Remember Abbottabad.) 2. Much of Indian media exaggerates wildly. (Remember nutty demonization.) 3. Social media mobs in both countries view skeptisim as a form of treason. #HappyFactChecking #Balakot
 Genuinely curious. India probably knew about these supposed camps before any of these attacks right. Then why do we only attack them when there's a serious transgression. Why not attack them when we find them. I mean they are 'terrorist camps' after all. So Pakistan will either deny their existence at all or support our attack, since they are soooo intolerant of terror. You guys sound excited , I'm scared. This can escalate to full scale war. Would love to see before and after satellite pictures.  For all those wondering:

Su30s are Air Superior Fighters which mean that they can dominate around 200 kilometers around them in all dimensions. They can be used for bombing runs but then that would limit their superiority in terms of having fewer Air to air missiles. For this reason, the SU30 was used to scare the F16s away (they are nowhere near capable of competing against SU30s) and the Mirages can quickly bomb the targets. This is one of the reasons Indian Air Force keeps a variety of aircrafts.

 Is Balakot in Pakistan or in POK?

It's pretty misleading on TV where they say in POK and then say xyz district of Pakistan.  That's why Chinese Maal can't be trusted, even if it comes to radars. 

Well done IAF. Jai Hind. While I am proud, I am also pretty scared of a full scale war Which one is true India's claim or Pakistan's claim? (serious question) Reuters is saying the jaish camp was missed by a kilometer!
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-kashmir-pakistan-scene-idUSKCN1QF13U I think this is the beginning to a massive crackdown on terrorists in and around LOC. Separatists in J&K will now be targeted. Come on, Indian Armed Forces! We're all cheering you on!

I just hope that our response is enough to impact them (and kill some bastards), but not to escalate the situation. War would be bad, *really* bad.   Former Air Chief Marshal Vinod Patney told CNN-News18 that after Pulwama attack India had to retaliate and do something.

“If they have really gone deep into Pakistan then it says two things: Our planning and lack of planning on the other side. Of course, there are some characters on the other side who will say nothing happened.”

 I'm gonna wait until some images surface. The only images I see so far are from Pak mil. which don't look credible given the size of craters involved. Reports have been saying at least 200 terrorists eliminated. How credible is this information?  https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1100227776618131457

> IAF Sources: At 0330 hours on 26th February a group of Mirage 2000 Indian Fighter jets struck a major terrorist camp across the LoC and completely destroyed it.

https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1100276734631571456 Just ventured into Pakistani subreddit. Images of a few felled trees and debris are being circulated, posted by their General on Twitter.
 They're claiming the jets missed their target, but I don't remember any payload only good for felling a few trees lol. 
Probably just an attempt by their army to hide their incompetence by false claims, not surprised ( remember Abbottabad? ). If pak retaliates by striking IAF bases it would mean war. Even Musharaff era millitary command wouldn't escalate the situation like this.

That leaves any Pak retaliation via JeM or another terror group or even just increased cross border firing and terror incursions through the LoC Coming from a Pakistani I really hope things get between us, that's all. Too OP, plz nerf Hi India,

&#x200B;

I want to know how acceptable is ABP news? Just heard their new anchor yelling that the death toll is between 200 to 300. Serious question: Who takes all these decisions? I mean who gets to call the shots on whether or not to attack?  A very rare display of action backed by rational thought.
It's great that if Pakistan appeals to the UN, it will automatically be claiming that the terrorists are their own people. Actionable evidence? Even if they have dropped 1000K of tomatos - the stampede would have killed them anyways. :D  [Special Discount by Burger  Singh](https://i.imgur.com/fbf5v12.jpg) Is this the location of the hit ?

Just a question, we're the IAF waiting for the Aero India to finish before undertaking these strikes? While this is a ballsy move if true, even more ballsy is using Mirage fucking 2000s for an operation like this.


Those jets are basically Bajaj scooters of fighter jets  Let us see the pakistanis bringing out their A game with more hidden world renowned terrorists doing the deed along with their rogue army. [removed] Can we have a thread for memes? Hopefully the MoD gives a brief statement regarding casualty of terrorists soon Pak government just confirmed it Hope those fucking politicians can sort out the Rafale deal now. More firepower would be great in the days ahead. Fuck Pakistan for supporting that scum Army and Air Force got a chance for a strike. When is it Navy's turn? Rumors about Pakistani artillery positions are firing towards India. Jai Hind [deleted] I have never really felt this proud of indians

As much as I condemn wars and violence that involve thousands of lives lost, I'm really proud of them. They did something brave, unpredictable and amazing.  Well this could become a big clusterfuck Revenge is a dish best served cold!  

Good that no civilians were killed How credible is Republic TV as a news channel? I’m watching it since the last 3-4 hours and I’m finding it extremely over the top. Some of their claims are hardly believable - 300 terrorists killed, Azhar Masood’s brother in law and nephew killed. What is their source?  Uri movie ke sequel ki script ready ho gayi hai ab.  Hopefully this doesn't escalate!  War is a dreadful thing. It should be avoided at all costs. That said, this is the time for us to take action. We have probable cause and we won't be able to justify this after the freshness of Pulwarma wears off. This can be seen as an act of retaliation instead of aggression, which would work in our favor if and when other parties object to it.  India today reporting 200-300 terrorists killed. Huge if true Donald Trump gave this away ,didn't he?  Finally some good news. I'm overwhelmed

On the other hand, can we do something to Masood Azhar like America did for Laden? Some tactical mission?

Jai Hind. More power to the Indian army. Hey all, I am from Pakistan. Hoping lot of down votes but as there a lot of mature people on Reddit other than hard core nationalist. How do you actually feel about this attack and the way main stream media channels from both sides acting. Another Surgical Strike! [removed] Why didn't India just take POK after each of the wars won? Is it due to external influence? They just got Bamboozled.  So anyone feels that basically Pak PM will come on TV and suggest

* Indian jets came close and crossed LOC, PAF was alert and then scared us away. 
* He will suggest we are lying, show some fake pictures and possibly
* Threaten India and it's desperation and says they will raise this in UN about crossing a sovereign nation etc. 

We wll encounter the same cowardly terrorist attack in some time again?

 Foreign Secretary said it was “non military pre-emptive strike” in simple terms based on intelligence data India deemed fit to protect its national security by preemptively killing those mofos. Great move India. India should be alert for now. Woot! Apologies for the ignorance, but can someone tell this white guy in Illinois what/where LOC is? I take it from context that it's roughly 40km into Pakistan?

Edit: Knowing LoC means ""line of control"" is super helpful :) Well done IAF! Alright, this statement is laughable, really. https://mobile.twitter.com/ANI/status/1100264411040702465

If IAF shoots down Pakistani aircraft, then pilots would be landing on friendly territory. PAF could always request more air support. To think that PAF will not engage with a dozen planes is ridiculous.

Secondly, if they dropped 1 tonne bombs, then the area would have flattened out. Great move by India. Pakistan is now in a very tough position.




Pakistan have claimed that there are no damages or casualties. This puts them in a bad position if they were to retaliate. If they retaliate against Indian military forces, it's an acknowledgement that they DO have terrorists in Pakistan AND that their army knows of, and supports them. If they attack civilian targets, they instantly lose all international support.



So their only option is retaliating through their terrorists, which is something Indian security forces are prepared for. Why are New York Times and CNN saying that there have been no casualties and that the Airstrikes are fake? They are supporting this by mentioning Pakistani General tweets !?!? this is absurd Well done IAF. We are proud of you. Pakistani forces were caught with their pants down. Going around 50km inside pakistan in KPK is no small feat. Shows the incompetence of PAF. 🤗🤗

 Pak- "" We will give a befitting reply to India for this attack.""

Modi-"" Yeh PUBG wala hain kya?"" This is so sad. Such a massive ballsy move by India and it's Air Force to avenge our martyrs both from recent attacks and past. Something to be proud of as an Indian; a time to stand behind our forces and yet there are people on this thread whose first concern was whether a politician would use this for chest beating or not.

Now is not the time folks. I am having a hard time to accept when there has been zero proof from any official sources. Not the airstrikes but if we were able to target those camps. News channels still don't have precise info on this thing or any video proof. Everyone is reporting something different. In twitter there are videos circulating of Apache helicopter strikes as Jets strikes and people are believing it. There is lot of hatred on twitter because of which i don't even want to browse anymore. I will wait for some confirmation. Until then i will hold my judgement on this.  Pakistan decided to burn some random forest and claim Indian bombs fell there.

Source:-https://twitter.com/OfficialDGISPR/status/1100231826348617728 Lol guess who just won the 2019 elections.  Pakistani here, you can downvote or answer a fair/objective question. If Pakistani military has offered for anyone to come and investigate the location of bombings (including Indian military/journalist) then why not take this offer up? It would be naive to say that militairies don't twist the facts and i'd for one would like to challenge the narrative from both ends and understand who's bullshitting ( be it Pak army or Indian army). But we won't know until proof or verification is done. (Keep it civil please and lets talk about this attack specifically) And of course NYT crusades on for Pak's behalf -

[https://nyti.ms/2tB6lax](https://nyti.ms/2tB6lax) It's all over the news, this was ballsy and much appreciated.  Foreign Secy Vijay Gokhle in his PC, 'India struck the biggest training camp of JeM in Balakot.'

'The facility is located in thick forests, on a hill top away from civilians.'

Hence, the pictures of forests doing rounds on r/Pakistan.

 Ahh, that's hot. That's real hot Wouldn't it be funny if Pakistan retaliated with jets of their own but instead they would get shot down by SAMs in place? 😂 The Guardian, The Washington Post and The New York Times confirm the strikes but question the casualty numbers. Apparently Balakot stopped have large training camps after the 2005 earthquake when foreign aid came in. So the numbers given by the government with 200-300 dead seem unlikely. I don't remember US drone strikes ever having that big numbers. So likely JEM dead will be significantly smaller. Modi the mad man did it. He's set such a high percedent of retaliation that no future prime minister can't follow without losing an election. Plus he's comfortably won this year's elections without doing much. Congratulations to him I guess. What's going to happen to the rest of us after this year though? This is really scary. We could be at war again Are you guys aware that crossing LOC is a declaration of war? Are we ready for war? Seems like it actually happened.

"My mood since past few days.  Aadarsh balak gone wild It's interesting that my parents did not want me watching too much television when I was growing up and now I don't want them to. My parents are the real visionary. They were always against the consumption of media and removed Television in 2007. Details, saliva coming out of the parents mouth is so profound.  Apologies for injecting as a stranger in this sub, but this applies so strongly to the United States, it's almost poetry :( Media, People who pretend to be smart and know everything. I see my friends in India have the same problem we have in the US. Media brainwashing the older generation.  Why is Modi peeking into Adarsh Balak's house? Did his IPS daddy ask him to keep an eye on Adarsh Balika? So u r adarsh balak..  That's some good Photoshop on the TV screen!! kaka stalking kids now. No ladies first? 😂 It's probably true for most parents. They blindly believe everything they see on TV/WhatsApp and expect their children to do so too. 

it's very frustrating as all my efforts to 'educate' them fails and the ensuing argument leads to nowhere. The media channels use it to their advantages and sensationalise news. 

I also see a bright side to it. Our generation seems to be more aware of filtering content before believing and if it's true, we can expect the world to slightly improve.  Parents look addicted as much as the old woman in Requiem for a Dream. ""Bal Narendra"" saving his family from congress party propaganda , 1965 , colorized Anybody notice the time on the clock ?

"Unpopular Opinion: Divorce rate in India is less because most women are not financially independent. Let's face it, India boasts about its lowest divorce rate in the world, with just 1 percent. 
Only 13 out of 1000 marriages result in a divorce in India. 
It could be due to arranged marriages, society pressure and the stigma attached to it. Most importantly it is because of the financial dependence. 

Low divorce rate is an indication of unhappy marriages. Failed marriage is not the same as a divorce. Just the absence of divorce doesn’t mean all is well. Not an unpopular opinion.

Pretty much the truth. My own parents have a fucked up, unhappy marriage but like many others, my mother is financially dependent on my father, who never leaves an opportunity to remind her of that. He is physically and verbally abusive to her but she still finds ways to justify his behaviour or just completely ignore the reality. I used to think that this is how everyone's parents were like until I met other couples and now, I feel horrible for my childhood of perpetual fear and trauma while my parents fought and screamed, slept in separate bedrooms and took out their frustrations on me while barely tolerating each other for days on end. They still do this shit but I have learnt to cope with this bull-crap. I developed severe trust issues and a tendency to repress my emotional needs, something which makes a lot of people think I am too cold and reserved.  Don't you ever fucking dare to think that your marriage doesn't affect your kid. Culture and society too. My mom has been in an unhappy marriage with my dad for over a decade now primarily because society will shun me and my brother in the future (and her too) if they split up.

Not blaming her and all, but I think the fact that my parents stayed together in spite of despising each other so much has caused some irreversible trauma to me and how I see relationships. also because: _""char log kya kahenge""_ factor My parents divorced and I realized I hadn’t almost ever seen either of them so much content. Although, various organizations that require identity verifications need a reform for divorce cases. It’s not just the society that isn’t prepared for divorce, but even a lot of organizations, especially governmental. While I was getting my passport, which was after the divorce, I got screwed because as per my CBSCE graduation certificate, my mother used my father’s last name. But as per her own current identity proofs, she used her maiden name. The people at the office had no clue what to do, so they recommended using a proof that had my father’s last name as my mother’s. It doesn’t seem like a big deal, but for people who suffered in a relationship, getting to completely use their original name is a huge victory. Also considered taboo by our regressive society, their own families would rather see their sisters, daughters in abusive and unhappy marriages instead of ending said relationships because ""log kya kahenge"" Divorce rates in India are low not just due to women lacking financial independence but also lack of parental support and the fear of losing value in the collective eyes of the society which only considers women's value in relation to others (wife/mother/daughter). 

Recently, a woman was killed by her abusive husband after she was sent back by her father despite a previous violent episode. And that's tells you all you need to know about divorce as an option in India. My parents are miserable together, both cant stand each other. They constantly fight for little things. Theres no way in hell they will ever get divorced coz of our culture. Im never gonna get arranged marriage coz of it. Its either love marriage or single for life coz I dont want to go through what my parents went through ever again. [removed] same goes for my parents, my mom wanted to separate but can't due to this reason only ""Log kya sochenge?""
""Ghar kaise chalega??""
""Bachho ka kya hoga???""

:V Indian Marriages are just part of a mass breeding program. Its not two people marrying each other but two families marrying each other. Yes. I agree with the title and your post and it’s an interesting discussion.  

To add more views or perspective from my side,  
- India has a 6 month cool down period between when a couple files for a divorce & actually gets the divorce. They have to give a final decision after the end of 6 months. This period can be a contributing factor where differences between a couple can be resolved & hence they change their mind about the divorce.  
- In many cases, couples dont officially go through a divorce. The wife would forever go to her parent’s home & never come back to the husband’s place. They’ll still be seperated but their marriage won’t be officially annulled.  
  
edit: formatting One of my relative got divorced because she later found out that he was a drug addict.
But she had a child with her and now lives with her family. Its a good thing that she was financially independent.
She is still young and beautiful and could easily remarry but society is already looking down on her and remarriage will only label her as a whore.
Arrange marriages should be fucking banned. Unpopular opinion: Fact My mother wanted divorce my father and I asked why can't she? She said who is gonna look after me and if she divorced where would she go. She doesn't earn or have capability to get a job to keep me in the school and daily needs. She was bound to live with this miserable even if she wanted to get out of this misery she couldn't. I understand she could get alimony but my father's family were cunning enough not making a marriage certificate after marriage. Also she didn't want me to suffer because of this so she went through all sorrow because she wanted to protect me. I wish my mother had a power of feminism. Plus, log kya kahenge.

Even for financially dependent and educated women, this is a taboo!!!

&#x200B;

One of my friend's husband died, she was all of 29-30 at that time. She still had to fight the world and people she considered her ""family"" to marry again. She is very happily married now! 10-20 years down the line, I can see the divorce rates climbing steadily. ""Low  divorce rate is an indication of unhappy marriages'"" out of context this would be such a retarded statement It could just be that it is a hassle to formally get divorced. Your nation may have an ""official"" rate of 13 per 1000, but in practice it could be that in about 25% of marriages, the partners are estranged from each other and do not live together, but they just haven't bothered conducting a formal separation through a court of law.

It's rather like a cohabiting couple who have biological children together, live under the same roof, hold joint accounts and pay a mortgage together - they may not be officially married, but they will be treated to all intents and purposes as though they are. Not me but my friend's story reflects this fact.

Her parents have an unhappy marriage. When she got a job in a different state, she along with her mother separated and moved out of her father's house and settled where she worked.

When I asked why they didn't get a divorce, her reply was ""Ab kya fayda yeh sab ka, alag toh ho hi gaye. Bas yeh hi thik hai, kyunki divorce mein kitna time lagega."" It's not an opinion. It's a fact and I think it's not unpopular as well.  I know a working couple who cant stand the sight of each other but arent yet divorced.


Divorce is just a huge hassle, can get very expensive too. The real unpopular opinion is that Divorce rates in India are less because our culture is rooted around the exploitation of women and even financially independent women are not able to get away from abusive families because of our misogynistic social system People still have fucked up views on divorced women in India 

But Sati was practiced here so I hope with new generation it changes and women are becoming more empowered at least in some pockets of urban India but rural India is a different story A bunch of reasons - 

1. Societal stigma in my opinion is the biggest reason till date. And this reflects in how a lot of related institutions behave - school admissions, employer support while going through a divorce, no appropriate channels of marriage counselling etc.
2. Alimony laws are very ill formed
3. An outlook that yells “live for others” - any attempt to seek personal happiness is seen as an act of selfishness. 
4. Financial dependence on spouse (mostly for women) - even educated stay at homes believe that they are doomed if they don’t get financial stability from their husband.
5. The fear of loneliness - chances of divorced people esp women to find a partner after a divorce is so looked down upon and there are literally no non-judgemental ways to do it. I just think the culture is f'd up. Almost all Indian women who've immigrated to Canada all have some form of abuse story. 

Culture treats women like second class citizens, disposable and used only for procreation and household chores. They're not given any respect.

I've never liked that about Indian people and India in general. It's heartbreaking seeing good people feel like they're not just because of the place they were born in and their gender. 

I say this as the first born kid of an Indian household myself, just the way my own mom gets treated and the stories I hear of other wives. It's the bitter truth. My mom is happy and financially independent, but the same can't be said about her sisters. >Most importantly it is because of the financial dependence. 

Even with financial independence, getting divorced is hard. Women rarely get emotional support to get out of a bad marriage and follow through on a divorce. When your own family treats your divorce as a embarrassment rather than a means to protect yourself from harm (or in a non domestic violence situation as an amicable split between rational adults), divorce becomes a impossible pill to swallow. The emotional pressure around preserving your marriage till death do you apart is ridiculous. And the fact that most of the indian parents would put their children's career and well being first so that he could finally score more marks than sharmaji ka beta. Most divorces have effects on the bringing up of a child. But it would be good  If a woman/man could move away from abusive marriage. So India need independent and educated woman for the sake of this society My parents have nowhere near as bad of a marriage as some people in this thread, but it's a terrible mess. My dad had a manic episode (he's bipolar) within months of being married to my mom and her dad was this close to getting them divorced. But nahh, her mother said something to the effect of ""it's okay, you can change him for the better"" and basically supported this shit show.

No, just no. Stop romanticizing arranged marriages - that's not how it works. You can't ""change"" a person. Marriage is built on compromise and understanding and *not* on these dumbass Bollywood-esque ideals.

Seeing how shitty of a marriage my parents have - to the point that my mother is basically a shell of who she used to be, all because of my dad's toxic/JustNo family - I'm just completely turned off by the concept of a relationship itself, let alone marriage. 

I sincerely believe that she should divorce him, but since it's not an option, I've been trying to take her with me. My current plan of taking a job outside my city has been put on hold till at least 2020, so that's a shame. But soon... very soon. >Low divorce rate is an indication of unhappy marriages.

>Just the absence of divorce doesn't mean all is well

So true. People here always seem to take facts and twist them and try to tell them in a way that makes Indians/India look better. And they NEVER seem to doubt their integrity.

Like how it's easy to find people saying, ""India has so many engineers and scientists in other countries, Indians are so smart"" but they fail to mention that India also has a huge population (3 times that of USA) so its natural for India to have more engineers, students face societal pressure to pursue the sciences and many are unhappy, most engineers are also not at par with those in the west. And when someone says that India has so many rape cases, then they are quick to point out that the reason for that is the population.

The Indians online trying to say that India is perfect and the best country in the world and any criticism is completely wrong and biased are ruining the country. The first step to fix a problem is to identify and understand it. Oh my god, YES!
I remember having this conversation with my mom. According to her, people in love marriages end up getting divorced (she totally supports arranged marriages, pray for me) and she also cited examples of people who had love marriages and then got divorced. 
My father on the other hand, thinks divorce is a 'western' thing. But the only reason that's true is because women there are independent. That's a big factor. I'll also add that most of the marriages in India happens between people having same belief system (religion, culture, region). I believe it's also a contributor. I just shared this post in family whatsapp group and I've sturred up a shit storm lol 😂 OP that's really good post👍 My dad has cheated on my mom several times and he is still cheating on her with a lot of other women.My mom is a doctor and is completely financially independent but she is still with him because “long kya kahenge” and also because she said that they are too old now to think of a divorce.
I have heard them scream and shout at each other over the years and now that I’m an adult and living with them,it’s hard being a witness to a “compromised” marriage.
One of the few reasons why I’m absolutely terrified of marriage :( Oh.. I hate the stigma of divorce. Divorce in not a problem. It is a solution to a problem (the problem being dysfunctional marriage) Low divorce rates doesn't betoken more contented couples, just like low conviction rate doesn't mean low crime rate. A shitload of people are living in unenviable marriages because the stigma associated with divorce and of course, it is nothing to be proud of. But people here are proud of really stupid things( like being proud of biggest democracy in the world!!, I mean what's to be proud of in big-ass population ? Thriving towards most transparent democracy anyone?) A lot of Asian cultures have the mindset of pride before happiness. So a lot of couples just suffer in silence to avoid the embarrassment of divorce. We need to improve our divorce rate, broken homes and emotionally scarred kids.

No one Not just financial factor but there are other factors too, many women are financially independent but still they don't go for divorce, moreover there is provision in constitution  by which husband is bound to support his wife even after divorce.Don't forget in rich and poor sections of society women usually works. But it is about social norms and traditions.

And another angle, even men don't go for divorce even though they are economically independent,  not every divorce have to be initiated by women.  so reason of low divorce rate is  BEYOND ECONOMICS. It's a fact, not an unpopular opinion. Very much true. I have seen my parents’ relationship for the past decade and I can relate. Financial independence is a contributing factor. However, I believe social stigma is the primary reason for prolonging unhappy marriages in India. An Indian woman can still leave her abusive husband if it means she'll have to live a more austere life. Unfortunately, the cost of divorce extends way beyond that and a divorcee in contemporary Indian society risks alienation from her own family despite being the victim. You can voluntarily choose to cut down upon your own standard of living and make peace with it, but you can't make peace with the persecution that you will be subjected to for the rest of your life. Along similar lines,our families stay together not because of love or respect,but because of financial issues. It's true, my parents are separated because of marital discord and my mom could not divorce as she is not independent and I also have a younger sibling. If she were financially dependent she might have filed for divorce long back. Pair this fact with India's population , and just imagine the number of ppl stuck in shitty marriages. >Low divorce rate is an indication of unhappy marriages. Failed marriage is not the same as a divorce. Just the absence of divorce doesn’t mean all is well.

My coworker is from Kerela and was arranged to be married to a family's son who lives in the US. That was 20 years ago and she boasts about her country not having divorce and here is so many. All while complaining about her husband and his constant drinking and over the course of their marriage he has been physically abusive with her. When she complained to me again about him, I asked why she didn't leave, and she went on about culture and they don't believe in it, her family will disown her, etc etc. I'm not saying every women is like her but arrange marriages need to stop.

So yeah if a majority of women were in forced marriages and cannot leave as they will literally have no one to turn to, what else can they do but stay? This is absolutely true. In fact, if you look at the regional variation, divorce rate is higher in the north east and South India, where women are in general more educated, better employed and the composite penalty of a divorce (social, economic, cultural) is less. 

The divorce rate of Mizoram is four times more than Haryana. This doesn't mean that women in Haryana are that much happier with their marriages. It's just that they don't have a viable alternative. 

When a society stops treating women like property and starts treating them like people, divorce rates are bound to increase. And that is a good thing. Completely agree with this. All this Indian culture, family value and all is total B.S. I had a grandpa, he died 10 years ago. When he was alive, out of his four sons only one (my dad) agreed to take care of him. Others will just ignore him or pretend that it's my father's responsibility anyway (the main point being he was unemployed for a few years and got help from my grandpa, hence he should be the one doing medicals and all). Cut to his funerals, everyone is crying like crazy!! Acting like they have lost someone irreplaceable from their life when earlier the same person was not good enough to even talk for a few minutes. The main point was, my grandpa had a lot of property and everyone wanted their shares. Still, these morons who keep fighting over minuscule details, again and again, have the nerve to tell me that I should remain in touch with our family since it is our culture. That I should respect these misogynistic, casteists fools as they are my elders and will provide guidance in my life. Fuckk off!! I have google for that. While what you said is true, a high divorce rate is not a sign of a good society. Some of the divorce rates in developed countries like USA(more than 50%) is fucked up. That means half the children grow up in broken families. That has a tremendous impact on a child's life.

Edit:Disclaimer: Anyone in abusive relationship(physical or mental) deserve to take divorce. 
(This is for people who are completely missing my point that higher divorce rate doesn't mean a progressive healthy society.) Divorce cases are much more commonplace nowadays compared to the 80's or 90's. LOL, unpopular opinion? What rock did you crawl out from? Totally agree. And lack of education (which is changing in current generation )
Also the pressure on them by the society It's not an opinion. It's a fact. Incomplete fact, but part of the fact nonetheless. Divorce should be considered as solution and not a problem That is not an unpopular opinion. It is not even an opinion. It is a hypothesis that can possibly be verified with enough evidence and appropriate controls. However fucked up your father or mother or your guardian maybe, YOU CANNOT CHANGE SHIT! You can go around it thinking that you will tame/change him/her down but consider this, it takes a lot to change a human being of that age group. They are grown person carrying a lot of frustration, dissapointment, opinions etc that they had from their lives! You will affect yourself if you involve yourself into it, it would affect your life. And you ain't got time for that bullshit because you have your own life to build. Just pray that things be okay, stay with the one you think is being bullied and do your job. AND promise yourself that you will be the best PARENT for your kids, whatever it takes. IGNORE, ACCEPT, SUPPORT, FOCUS! I think half of the time is about the culture .. people tend to think..ohh.. she's been  divorced.. and who will marry her again blah blah blah ..this contributes to the thinking of women to tolerate more from their side Also they feel pressure from their own family to stay in marriage. Its like a jail without bars and you get emotional torch. Bro... In many cases, divorce is done to extract money from the ex-husband. As was my case. She didn't work and didn't even want to work. She (and her family) wanted easy money. This is how divorce rates have actually increased One of the reasons but not the only reason. People are conservative due to the upbringing in most of the rural and some parts of urban areas as well, because of that divorce is shunned in their respective communities. 

From what I saw in my life, happiness in India is societal affair where in you will be happy only when you do something you like as well as it is within the norms of the society. This is not unpopular, nor is it an opinion.

It's a fact.  This is done on purpose.  It's a method of control. There was actually a study done by Ashley Madison (a site for extramarital affairs) which found out that the countries where the income gap between men and women was lower, had more parity in the number of men and women looking for extramarital affairs. Countries where this income gap is higher or where women are more financially dependent on men, women are less likely to indulge in extramarital affairs. India actually boast about that?? The nerve these guys have ... It is not just the lack of financial independence, it is also the fear of losing every other societal connection (parents, relatives and sometimes even friends) when choosing to divorce. Divorce also hinders a women's ability to enter into future relationships. This will get better over time as more women get educated and enter the workforce and overall increase in urbanization. Whoever said it is an unpopular opinion. It is more staying together for the kids, but yeah you have a point. Financial dependence is one major factor, I agree. But, I think ""society"" still plays a big role in the decision. We as people are still not able to accept that there is nothing wrong to admit that a mistake was made. The social image is still more important than happiness for so many people out there.  
 Plus, in such an environment, it takes a lot of courage to admit that there is a problem and to act on it. A lot of statistics which represent arranged marriages are thus skewed. Many people say that the divorce rate of our country is much lower, which means arranged marriage is a successful system. Truth is, most people live in unhappy marriages, unable to divorce due to financial dependence, societal pressure, being together for kids etc. I want to present a different story. 

&#x200B;

I am 30+ , Male , married for 5 years.  Working in BLR. Earn pretty well, wife works too. no kids. 'almost' arranged marriage. 

Wife has cheated on me multiple times despite catching her red handed. 

I even gave her the option of a mutual divorce and call it quits, no harm no foul.

She said no.  (Got the feeling she wants to have her cake and eat it too).

&#x200B;

Why I am in this marriage even after a year of giving an ultimatum ?

I believe in marriage, and I had some hope of recovery at the time, even after this big an issue.

&#x200B;

But now, I have lost hope and this post had mildly triggered me into posting after all the ""abala nari"" posts im seeing here. 

I dont see a future with her,  cannot visualize myself starting a family with her, and most of all, cannot trust her. 

&#x200B;

Can wait to see what fresh hell divorce is gonna bring up. Dont care about log kya kahenge that much, but I do worry for my parents.  I had more than insisted on this match at the time of marriage and my parents swallowed a lot of issues during that time.

&#x200B;

I know this doesn't have much on topic at hand here, but I just wanted to vent. 

I do believe that divorce is not a bad thing, but it is a last resort.  The last year was devoted to recovery, but unfortunately, Im not seeing the signs I wanted. I wonder if pets stay with us for the same reason. Too many factors at work here. You cannot just combine them and generalise it to women not being financially independent.

But yes, Low divorce rates does not really mean happy marriages. Not really an unpopular opinion, just a popular one that isn't said out loud I disagree that it is *only* about financial independence of women. It's this self-propagating culture that we have that mistreats women and allows them to mistreat themselves (and have them feel that it is normal). Financial independence is only an (important) cog in this machine.

My dad isn't an alcoholic, he isn't an evil person at all, and my mother knows how to stand up for herself when needed. **Yet** I saw his dominance permeate through every inch of the household. When things got heated for a stretch of nearly 5 years, I was in college, and going home was a nightmare. The fights every day, the shouting, the emotional blackmail, the crying. *Every day*. If it was any western country they would have divorced a long time ago, but he was retired, she was a housewife, and we didn't have much money. There was huge familial pressure as well, my mother would have been isolated from her familial circles. A divorce would have given all of us mental peace but financially both of them would have been really bad as well. So the emotional torture continued. It wasn't home anymore, I didn't want to go there, all I wanted was to go away. And after my studies I moved out the instant I was able to. 

Then I realised how emotionally stunted I was, and how my relationships with women were screwed up. It took me some years to go back and deal with all this trauma, and trace the line back to my childhood and how this patriarchy dominated every aspect of family life. 

The wounds are still healing, but the last time I visited them I told them very clearly not to interfere in my personal life. I'll do what I want to do, I'll make my own mistakes, thank you very much. I was nice and respectful to them, but I unambiguously let them know that I'll marry whoever I want, Indian, black, white, muslim, it doesn't matter. I do not want an arranged marriage at any cost. And my mother told me, almost crying: ""remember, marriage is only for one time in your life"" (she was obviously thinking that in the west people get divorced every 2 years or whatever). I was shocked, how could you of all people say such a thing? She seemed to have internalised all the crap that happened, and now she is an ardent defender of the culture that wreaked havoc in our lives. A defender of the great Indian culture versus the debauchery of the west. Great.

The worst part is that there is no single person to blame. As mentioned, my dad isn't a bad person, he was just acting the only way he knew, he is a product of his upbringing and his influences. So is my mother. So am I. But at least now I am repairing my wounds, and I am doing everything I can not to propagate this culture any further. Unpopular  opinion : the rates are so low ALSO  because we know to adjust and go on with our life.  I don't belive just wife or husband hopping is the  secret key to happiness . Let us me honest, considering how ""awful"" (many) Indian husbands are, it is a surprise that wives decide to stay in bad marriages.  I feel 13/1000 is not accurate. I personally know more than 13 failed marriages (Friends, family, acquaintance, people in my society). The number has to be more. I wouldn't say this is an unpopular opinion as much as it is an inconvenient truth. 

&#x200B;

Men don't see it because of their privilege, and women with privilege will rarely ever face it. UNFORTUNATELY, NOT AN UNPOPULAR OPINION. AT LEAST IN LITERATE CIRCLES. Someone give me a gold so I can give it to OP. Seeing comments over makes me so depressed and upset, and almost made me cry. 

I'm so thankful that my parents weren't that way with each. They love each other to the very end, and they and an arrange marriage. But my dad's cousin had a divorce, it was a very hard phase for him. There were a lot of factors in the process of his broken marriage, his mother didn't like the wife, even though they had an arrange marriage, his wife was too outspoken and hot headed, the society would make certain remarks and the fact that they both didn't realise that honeymoon phase isn't forever. They weren't allowed to have a divorce for 9 months, after they'd applied. And the whole family, even though they shouldn't, had told them to 'make it work'.  

One day, he ran away. 

There are so many cases of bad marriages around me. Even my uncle and aunt, though you'd see them and say they are in very successful marriage, I can see that my uncle blackmails and emotionally and psychology tortures and bullies my aunt. He'd call her a 'whore' and say that she's dressing up just to attract other males. My aunt wouldn't say anything, but I know that she's quite depressed. I rarely see her smile, and it's been 22 years in their marriage. When I ask her why does she tolerate it she'd say that in her age and with her kids, she can't do anything to retaliate. The most she can do is indulge him in a small banter. 

And I being 19, don't feel like getting into any kind of marriage or relationship. And just to say someone no, I'd say I'm asexual and aromantic. 

World's too harsh, specially in this country. I understand what you’re trying to say here, but I do however want to point out that the statement“low divorce rate is an indication of unhappy marriages” is logically not correct. 
A low divorce rate ‘may’ imply the lack of will to divorce, which ‘may’  be a consequence of the financial dependence of wives in India (although I don’t know if this is factually true), 
Hypothetically, if data such as “time spent separated”, or “frequency of arguments” was available, that would (possibly) indicate potential unhappy marriages I'd put societal pressure and stigma as bigger reason as compared to financial independence, but you're right. Nothing unpopular about this, its a fact which everyone knows, even if they don't want to openly admit or talk about it. That's the design. This is correct.... Indeed. And, to a lesser extent, cultural constructs that abhor breaking of the family. Someone's watching Patiala Babes (or not) So much for ouR kAlchar warriors Yep. My exact beliefs. Could part of it be attributed to different expectations from marriage? The idéal of marriage being the conjugation of Mr. and Mrs. Ideal-for-each-other towards living forever in-love is not the sole ideal in India.

For many Indians, marriage is about procreation and having a family, strengthening ties between families or for economic reasons. Personal happiness is not solely defined by the relationship with the wife/husband. And for many people, the arranged marriage system caters to this need very well.

This would mean that people unhappy with their spouses would have more important reasons to stay together despite love ending. For women, this might be economic, but might often be much much more (itt parents staying together for their kids, yada yada) Agreed, and if anyone is denying this, they're kidding themselves. Come on. True.  
And might I add, the peer pressure.

The family of the girl doesn't support the move of her Totally and completely agree. Divorce rate is definitely going to increase coz girls are getting more and more educated and independent. And it's not a bad thing. Marriage is not a do once suffer whole life kind of deal as older generation persters us. People change, circumstances change, and sometimes leaving is better than staying and suffering. But alas, the generation of boasters will be long dead until the days of ""secure marriage"" India change No one will probably see this but my story is the opposite. Have an extremely abusive mom who has physically mentally emotionally and spiritually abused me my mom and my dad while being ultra kind to my sister. My dad has worked constantly to provide for my mom and our family, never used the money against her and really she has final desicion for everything financial. Emotionally he is there for her and all of us as well and is like the perfect example of a dad no matter how horrible her abuse has gotten. After nearly 2 decades of it he still won’t say anything bad about her while my sister feels entitled to yell at him and blame him for my moms abuse because it “affects her and it’s all our fault anyways” meanwhile she has hit me and so has my mom many times yet somehow us guys are the abusive ones. It’s sad but we have a somewhat functioning family despite all that. Sucks being abused so badly and having everyone assume you’re some horrid sexist abusive pig when in reality you’re suffering as a victim and one who keeps giving to this day more than what they ever should.

Edit: the worst / funniest part is when my sister goes on a rant about how women like them won’t be taking shit from abusive men like us any more because they are feminists... I bring up the fact she’s physically abusive and victim blaming and suddenly she has every excuse in the world about how physical abuse is justified when it’s a women to a man for any reason including her emotions not being fully controlled at that time.

Like seriously? You’re going to victim blame abuse victims by claiming they actually abused you and aren’t victims even though you’ve hit them and they’ve never touched you? Even though you verbally mentally and spiritually and emotionally abused them somehow because you feel like it actually you’re the victim?  What the fuck that’s just lying..it feels like they are incredibly sexist and abusive and toxic victim blaming yet they still call us sexist and abusive even though we don’t do anything to them and my dad pays for everything including rent at college, activities, spring break parties and rent for my sister and friends every year, my sisters food and sorority fees. tons of vacations the best of food, anything they want with no limits basically..

USA Indian 3rd gen YES YES YESSS This is so true in everyway I have had the same thoughts since many years. This is a sad, sad thread. Take care, all of you. Wouldn't surprise me if India had less defamilization policies Related unpopular opinion: Rising divorce rates are a good thing - they more closely represent the ability of women to get out of bad relationships than they do the number of bad relationships overall. I dont think this is a bad thing tbh Agreed. Women end up putting up with abusive, insensitive husbands with no love in the marriage just because she has no where else to go. Divorce is next to impossible if they have children. Even though most women of the current generation are working professionals, men are still thought of as the primary bread winners. For once I feel that the generation who grew up in this fucked up shit will treat their sposes better, and will probably try to do better for their mom's when they are financially independent ! This is why women need to be educated and encouraged to work. 
My parent had a horrid marriage they were always fighting and yelling. 
When they separated it was the best thing ever, my mother was already working and determined to work further and become independent.
Today she owns homes all in her name. 
Very proud of her.
Only draw back, definitely don’t know what a functional marriage looks like. I’ve become overtly independent and have to teach my self to be co dependent when in a relationship. Well yeah same goes for my mother. Log kya kahenge ? I think it also has a lot to do with the “obligation” people feel to maintain the relationship given that the families were so deeply involved. Its not only that but Indians generally don't like to do it officially and so, they just split up but stay married. The power relationship in money, jobs is an important factor in divorce. Agree. Unpopular opinion : Unhappy marriages are better for children's future than divorced parents. I read somewhere long back that the divorce rates in urban India is actually 30-40%. Not sure of the accuracy, but I think it might be actually true... India has always made me cringe. They’re mean as hell over there. I often find that most of the people from India that realize this... well they move out of India if they can. I feel bad for the people who can’t. India looks nice and I’m sure there are some nice parts that aren’t as bad... but damn it sure is one of the more messed up places. The way they treat women and marriage over there is just... gross.  Not to mention almost every time I see something from India it gives off such a apathetic vibe. The population over there is wayyy too high too. Like they need to control it because I think that’s a huge factor for a lot of the societal problems. My mother wants to live separately from my psycho abusive dad. She plans to do that by becoming a teacher in a school owned by a mostly good Ashram.

A BEd degree is the most powerful thing that our victim mothers can get.

I wish we create a society in which government gives financial support to afford basic things to kids and women who want to escape the psycho men in their families.

We shall overcome. Someday. u/zak-smith92

I think you might wanna read some of these comments here. As others have already said on your post social media is probably not the reason for higher divorce rates in the west. When no-fault divorce was legalized in the US in the 1970s, divorce rate shot through the roof.

No-fault divorce meant you didn't have to prove that the other person was an absolute shithole to be granted the divorce, you just had to both want it. 

Is no-fault divorce available in India?

The ability of women to earn an actual wage outside the home also made divorce possible. The status of women in South Asia, Middle East and Central Asia have historically been lower than say East Asia regardless of religion which in turn leads to lesser development or lesser H.D.I. due to women not participating in nation building.

It's not only about Islam.

Only white hippies and the western media seem to be unrealistic view of India thinking that they are very enlightened because of Hinduism/Theravada and Tibetan Buddhism/Yoga studios and what not without knowing that's the same reason they are so undeveloped.

Even Mao Zedong who killed so many of his own people actually took steps to massively improve literacy rates for women thus making it easier for Deng Xiaoping to execute his economic policies. The fact the uk government give you something for being married has always concerned me. Probably cause of depression among lots of women Speaking from the perspective of a literal bastard, divorce can better than a bad marriage. But maybe relationship problems don't exist in India. And not the social stigma that shames men into assuming supreme responsibility of all emotional, financial and logistical issue of two families? Haamar kulcha iz da besht! Well indians just doing indian things... 
Proud indian. Just had the same thought about divorce rate in India last evening while was watching *desperate housewives* which is why the divorce rates are steadily increasing in the metro's (in double digits) i think its a good thing divorce rates are not high like in the west...the scenario that all men are torturing women is just bogus.what is needed in our society is proper counselors who can resolve normal wear and tear of marriage and help the couples resolve their differences. Amit Varma did a great episode called The Metrics of Women Empowerment on his podcast The Seen and The Unseen. One of the factors he talks about was divorce rates. what unpopular?

It is statiscally proven countries with higher education rates for women and financial Independence have higher divorce rates..

Same with fertility rates better educated women --> lesser children.

&#x200B;

It has nothing to do with religion/family values, In fact upperclass hindu women might have higher divorce rate than lower class christian or muslim women. While I agree with the general thesis, I believe humans are greatly motivated by the judgement of peers. When 1.5 billion people generally blame the woman for any issues with the marriage, divorce is not quite an option. Financially secure women also end up staying with incompatible partners. There are too many variables to even narrow down a particular answer. But finance might be slightly lower on the list. Money might seem like the obvious answer. But group identity is central to our constructed existence. Yes, it's the truth.

Also, because women are suppressed subtly and directly, so much that they can't even imagine themselves working. Their confidence is brought down by their own families and society. And then people laugh if they can't do a thing properly, like aunties driving a two wheeler. Have you wondered why they drive like that? Imagine being scrutinized and being under observation for even smallest of things. Demotivated by others even if you make a normal mistake. Fighting against the norms and resistance and then driving. If you can imagine that then you will have your answer. Doesnt a wife get a part of her husband's earnings after divorce? Why on earth this is an unpopular opinion? This is not even an opinion in the first place. This is a fact. Yes, unpopular but the truth. I have been reading about ""Conflict and Conformity"" and read few research that show direct relationship between financial independence and divorce rate.  

In Americas there is a visible correlation in women employment and divorce rates. Also divorce rates are high in tribes with women having more independence or matriarchy societies. On the other side the societies  dependent on labor intensive work for survival, like the Americans using the plow for farming back in 80's saw a very low divorce rate because the partners were kind of bound and had very bad chances of survival outside the marriage.  

I'd say India have taken this shit to almost next level where not just the couple is bound together, they are subjected to other kind of boundations too, like they feel obligated to conform to parents and relatives. The worst example of this is marriage based on cast, where most of the curry generation don't believe in it but still will conform to their families choice.  

Okay, on the other side, broken families leave a very bad impact in the kids involved. We humans learn from seeing others and our own relationship forming methods are dependent on what kind of relationship our parents had. Bad marriages most of time lead the child to have lack of self esteem, self doubt and insecurities and bad relationship forming methods. Lack of father figure really damages one.  

So, though I really despise the current Indian social structure but I also appreciate few positive aspects it have. I'd say society is a dynamic thing and I believe we'd see a very steep swing in values in next decade or two. 10/10 agree and also most of the divorce cases that ARE filed in India are done by men. on a side note, what is absolutely boggling to me is when the court grants Restitution of Conjugal Rights. Is it true though? My dad has been leeching of my mom for years and yet she loves him to the core to leave him. Couldn't agree more dude.
It has nothing to do with arranged marriages being magically stable somehow BS.
It has everything to do with women not being independent enough to get out of bad situations.
Having lived in US for many years now, I see a huge contrast in the voices women have here vs my mid-sized hometown... also.. if you get a divorce... then log kya kahenge?? Even though your opinion sounds fair but if low divorce rate is an indication of unhappy marriages and we know high divorce rate is not happy marriage either, then how tf you can end up with happy marriages? I am writing this on the basis of what I've heard from a close friend who's been separated for 4 years from her abusive husband.

Another factor is the extremely divorce allergic judicial system, where everyone from the police (who are reluctant to file any FIRs), all the way to the judge, try to convince the woman or man to ""work it out"", either between themselves or through court mandated mediation, at every stage.

They wear you down to the point where you start questioning whether such ""small things"" (like physical violence, emotional coldness, mental harassment!!!!) which are ""chalti rahti hain in every marriage"" are worth walking out for.

The lowest point for my friend was when the lady judge told her that ""atleast he only hit you once na, not on daily basis. We all lose our temper from time to time."" Thankfully the judge was replaced by someone else, but her divorce has been dragging on for 4 years now with no end in sight. The entire process is burtal torture. So true...one family acquaintance has been in a  bad marriage, where the man has been a serial cheater for years. She has come close to divorce many times but financial constraints get in the way. Also, life for single women in India is very, very hard. Especially in small towns, harassment and stalking of vulnerable women is very common, police does jack shit about it, doesn't even acknowledge it as a crime. Societal pressure, archaic laws, court decisions are biased towards female which forces most male to stay in unhappy marriages.

Financial Independence might be minor contributor towards this, its usually the alimony and maintenance which sends down the fear. It’s true , I don’t see how it’s an unpopular opinion Also log kya kahenge factor However, for the cases where women are financially independent, I think, it's more due to societal pressures and expectations that failed marriages do not lead to divorce. This might be true for cases where financial independence is absent for the wife.
In India, if a husband-wife relationship reaches a condition where divorce is imminent, the entire close family, extended family, extended-extended family pours in advice, anecdotes, future scenarios to the couple. This is highly effective to stop divorce, but the marriage still ends up being failed. I wholeheartedly agree with people saying it's because of the ""log kya kahenge"" thing. I live in a gated community and the neighbour aunties are some of the most vicious retarded people I've ever seen. A divorced woman has recently moved back to her apartment with her son (she stayed previously with her husband too) and the gossip wheel was turning with full speed and my mother was flabbergasted when one of the aunties angrily huffed why that lady was not telling her what had happened she wanted to know. Our society is full of idiots who dont understand privacy empathy etc and it results in extreme attempts to keep a happy image in front of ""society"" so that they are not judged and ostracized. “Jo khud shaadi nahin kr skte wo divorce to bilkul nahin kr skte” Hi mine is not that worse problem but it is something that is going to destroy two or probably 3 life.. my girlfriend has just given 3rd year exam and her father almost forced her to get married just because the boy that her father chooses has a decent job....he is not ready to hear any opinion of her girl and is also prepared to stop her study if she argues much. Though after a huge melodrama her father let her to complete m.sc and warns her that she will not get any more time after that. And also told her that she has no right to choose her life parter and has to marry the boy whome his father choose. My girlfriend is now in a very depressive state but her father just ignore all of this as if it is normal.
I think there is nothing to be said to justify this kind of nature and if this is called the heritage culture i will be very happy to kick it out. I think divorce rates in India are low because we Indians have seen our parents fight, we have seen them go through the ups and downs of their lifes, and yet despite how bad the arguments get. They still can't live without each other. I think the reason divorce rates are high is because, at least in my opinion, we still value people who can take charge and keep their desires under control and not the other way around.  


PS: If you don't see urself staying loyal to 1 person for the rest of your life, plz do not let the pressure of getting married get to u. Todays world of Tinder and rise of acceptance among the youth means people of our generation won't be looked down on simply because they chose to be single. the truth. Holy shit dude i never thought about it like that.
One more thing while we are talking about ground breaking discoveries. Maybe the Sky is blue because blue light is scattered in all directions by the tiny molecules of air in Earth's atmosphere. Blue is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This is why we see a blue sky most of the time. I'm sure the countries with higher divorce rates must be having a higher happiness rate as well. Imagine all the unhappy marriages leading to unhappy people and a general distress in the country at all times. That's a simple fact. While we discuss this issue, aren't divorced men also shunned off in societies? I think divorces lead to a fall of social statuses of both genders, it's a risky move for both parties. Also monogamy is strongly enforced in our cultures. Sorry but I don't see women in my office or who are financially independent getting divorce. Financial Independence is not the only reason. I think it's the society that's responsible for the low divorce rate. Divorce in India is seen as a taboo and if you say that you're a divorce people will look down upon you. It is also low because divorce is still not seen as a viable socially acceptable opinion. And India is not unique in its 'arrange marriage' customs. These were also norms in UK and USA 100 years ago and a divorcee would be seen as something too scandalous for families and would go great length to avoid it. This is very true. Very very true. Thought this was pretty obvious. It's kinda sad how relatable this entire thread is I agree with everything in that a lot of abusive relationships don't end precisely because of this reason, however I can't help but scratch my head based on anecdotal evidence. I know basically no Indian divorcees and within my own family and close relatives the couples seem to have great relationships with each other. Some feminists have an interesting take on it : often it's money in exchange for sex (more or less), so quite similar to prostitution. As someone who has lived both in India and overseas. And seen marriages and divorces in both countries. I think it's not a bad idea to have some society pressure. Cause I am married and trust me there are days where you want to give up and leave. But the pressure to commit to marriage and be compromising also helps go through it. And not just leave at the first big fight you have.",Non-Political
"Bought a book from Daryaganj for a 70 bucks. Opened it up later to receive this little surprise!!!  What a pleasant surprise!  I am wondering why the original owner sold the book in the first place considering he/she will never be able to have a new book with his autograph. That's a treasure of a life time. Certainly a glorious surprise.

Pls keep it.

This man was a treasure to this nation. Big if true You just got the jackpot buddy. Never let it go. Make sure it is his signature. Congrats ...I hope it's real. If not, pretend. I am really surprised to know that it is Kalamsaab's signature. Congratulations buddy I usually sign books with the authors name before donating them. It's worth it if the second hand book seller gets some extra money because of it. 

But this one seems legit though. Or an extremely well forged signature. This is a treasure. Chhota packet bada dhamaka When i read 70 bucks i was like woah how much and then i realized he means rupees How do we even know if it is original? Daryaganj Sunday book market. That's one thing i miss some times.  Nothing like that treasure trove for books. 
I once got a pre-1920 National geographic edition but then lost it. Sad.
Some books older than me in first print can still be there. Cheers. Buy some lottery tickets buddy I once purchased a Ruskin Bond book from Daryaganj which had autograph of Bond . Fuck u man so lucky Wow!!👍 so you outsmarted the bookseller. Why would someone give up a book signed by Dr. APJ!! 😅 Checks out:

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Abdul_kalam_autograph.jpg That's fantastic, OP! 

I was there myself this morning; it's always such a fun outing. Do you want to sell it!? Would love to have it! :D Who would sell that!!
I'd offer you 700 bucks can you sell me? God gift for u..all the best Lucky pleb! Oh hod that really awesome to You are a lucky person! Wow! holy cow !!!! dude !!! one lucky guy!! Wow! I just got goosebumps seeing this. You have to be a goddamn moron to sell this Would you like to sell it to me ?? You may never know what you may find in those book markets. There are some old classics books like war and peace..with that vintage hard bound covers..and they sell it for the same price as other normal books. I once signed a copy of a book myself. 
It's so common, people just do fake signs on their books and try to sell for a higher price. Wow its authentic signature,lucky find Damn! Lucky you! Woah that's great 🔥 Real signature? Spud did it. Did you just call this a l i t t l e surprise???? You terribly underpaid for this.

Lucky you!

Cherish it to the fullest. You can always check from the man himself if the signature is legit or not... GODDD😍 Holy shit that's crazy! Wondering why the owner would have wanted to sell it though. Why I never get autographed books from daryaganj :(

&#x200B;

PS: You hit gold. Ignited Minds is an amazing book, and that too autographed. You got lucky. Congrats. It's one of my all time favourites.  Enjoy.  You'll come back to it.  It does have The Godfather's effect on you. I once got 29/- in Google pay. :( Universe and human foolishness are infinite (on the original seller's end)!!! And dear sir: you are very very lucky... I'll happily buy this book from you for 71 Rupees. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) When are you appearing in the Indian Version of Pawn Stars. Rick will surely offer you a great price !! Wow, this is brilliant. I wanted to visit Sunday Bazaar but went to Raahgiri instead :( Wow lucky you And I thought only my handwriting is bad. You can’t know if the signature is genuine. I won several of Kalam's books as prizes for various competitions in school. That's how I was introduced to him. Awesome.. Lucky you. If its real, then its worth more than a million dollar jackpot. Ohh My God, really, you are very lucky budy. when god writes your future with his own hands. Treasure it 
Keep it safe as Ik as a bookworm that means a lifetime of happiness A real fucking treasure. Great man! What are the chances the book selled was playing with people's mind.

I mean just keep one signed copy everytime. Try to go to that shop again. Precious. Congrats for the steal!  
Am planning to go to a seminar held by Chetan Bhagat with his 4 novels I read long time ago...  
Hope he signs them. I will see you in the Pawn Stars next season Daryaganj. The Palika Bazaar of fake items (books in this case). you lucky, lucky human! This should cost a lot more than 70 bucks Man, you are one lucky son of a gun bro. I would have sold my kidney to get a book autographed by him. Keep it with you forever, its a treasure of a lifetime. Very nicely done .. Get it check by some expert to make sure that the Legend himself signed or did the previous owner did that! 70 dollars were well worth it! /s Wow I hope I don't see you in a future episode of Pawn Stars. You my friend have hit jackpot It would be surprising if you didn't pay close to ₹4.9k for a book. Unless bucks = rupees for you (don't watch too much American movies) It shall increase its value 10 times I buy second hand books only to get small surprises like this and...they are cheap. I have never been this lucky tho! 😟 Bam! Jackpot! Just asking if you d ever want to sell. Lucky! There is no better time to read this book than it is today. Plot twist: It was I that made that signature to make some dude happy. 

Mission accomplished. Means you have to unleash power within india. You can become hero. Also you are lucky so may 4orce be with you. You are worthy I need this kind of luck to clear JEE Wow! Just wow, lucky you. I remember having this book when in college and When we were leaving after graduation I sold most of my books. I  signed the books with the author's signature just before selling it..so I hope it's not that one. Oh my! Check the signature  is original or not by someone when I was small I used to do similar thing just right what I see on the page of every book I found Why our beloved pm never appreciates the work of apj , coz he is muslim? Lucky you 😍😍😍😍😍 so how much for the book now This is priceless! 😍 You lucked out op The owner was a true genius.
He must have did that on purpose, now read the complete book and give it to someone else who might want to read and don't sell. A surprise for sure but a welcome one. But what ifff the owner signed that shiz himself/herself Unworthy bitch, whoever gave it away. ₹70/- (rupees) hota hai mere angrez ki jhaat bucks nhi **You found treasure.** [deleted] I matched it with real signature and it look authentic. Someone is selling his Autograph on book at $250.

You can list in on ebay type website but better to keep it. How much to buy this? Willing to pay 70 bucks is loads but what a score You paid $70 dollars? Man thats my book . please return it. [deleted] I mean if u buy a book for 70 dollars wouldnt you expect it? i mean thats considering you didnt open the book and read it at all. Who reads books My guess is that it's a fake signature done by someone.",Non-Political

Hopefully will be going on the next expedition. Impressive!! That’s awesome, but mera ghar ke bahar goo Kaun hatayega it's very flash... sure it isn't some sort of interplanetary prototype? How deep does the snow get in winter? Are you sure it is in Antarctica? Looks great! This is great pic well done. I knew there was one but never knew how it looked. Woow This looks great.

that unmistakable smell of sucking up to smug bureaucrats Looks a lot like the Avengers facility Avengers were there No offense intended, but knowing how research in India is I wonder if it's more for the purpose of chest-thumping than actual scientific research work on the nation's behalf.

"I painted my uncle yesterday. I'm on my trip here in Punjab and have been trying to create this for years now. Oil in sketchbook, ""Darshan""  Its strange really. Every year I come here and think "" I really need to paint him"", and try to come up with the best ways to take his photo. It's been years of the idea stirring but yesterday he walked by and I brought my oils for the first time here so I just asked him to sit.. Its the result of years of brewing the idea. I'm so happy with it.

I used thick filbert brushes to get the textures and visible strokes. It took me about 30 minutes to paint and because I was painting fast, I didn't have time to smooth things out. It's an alla prima style, all in one sitting which shows my thought process in the work itself.  You've replicated his face so well. How did he react to it? nice work. jyunda reh puttar. That looks amazing, how long did it take? Did he have to sit while you were painting? Fraata in the background gives me nostalgia Bahut hi wadiya veer Incredible. O chaa gye! Guru Changa hai ji Which pind are you in? Beautiful. bowing down to your talent

Great work OP!  Liked your painting and backstory a lot.  Keep at it! This is beautiful :) Awesome Great.
You are the same guy who had posted picture of your uncle sitting on bed I think 6 months ago.
Where from Punjab????
 Dude awesome!
I want to paint like that too...any advice for a beginner like me? Nice work! :)  Quite a majestic painting my friend Amazing No words to say how beatiful this is and how many emotions this panting brings out. 


It's sorta of unbelievable that u did this in 30 minutes. 

I am also new to painting, will love to get here one day and paint my grandmothers beautiful face. Thanks for the inspiration and sharing this beauty with us. Thanks for the original content. Great painting. It took me a while to understand that it's not a giant sketchbook that he's holding beside himself :) That sketchbook looks fucking huge Excellent work. Did he like it? In the portrait, the face seems to be a little broader / rounder... but overall, its amazing.

Good work. Draw me like one of your french girls? This is so dope bro! Looks real sweet!

I have been following your work on IG for sometime now. The painting you made of all the Guru's was perhaps the best(i mean all your work is sweet but that was something special!). 

Keep up the good work! This is so beautiful! You've probably started something new, for better, in this sub. You. Are. A. Genius! love it; great talent  That's a brilliant painting This is amazing. Good work, OP.

I used to have artistic skills once but then college/time constraints happened. This looks brilliant.  Even his teacher calls him Zionspartan Sira lata veere! Badi ghaint lagdi payi. 

 attt veer ji Nicely Done thoda sa smudge hey Great effort man, You should start your business in this field Follow ""Blahjinder"" on Instagram, she does simmilar art! Amazing! That is really good! Would love to see one of those of the Pind or maybe just some scene in the Pind. Very nostalgic.  Beautiful word man. Any tips on how to start with oil painting? I do sketches with pens, pencils and charcoal quite well if I dare to say so, digital paintings too. But never tried oil though I've always wanted to. this is wonderful work, a bit disappointing that you left out his rabbit teeth :) i mean that in a positive way Beautiful His teacher calls him ZionSpartan Next time try staying sober, you hands were probably shaking that caused a blurry portrait.  I am so impressed by people who are capable of this. And so sad that I am not one of them! :( ZionSpartan?
 Great work 😊 Where did you get that book? 

nice painting.

Does oil paint get's dry on a book (paper) ! i never tried. Sorry, but I have to say that you didn't really capture his essence. You painted a guy with a similar beard, head shape and turban, but not your uncle, because you failed to paint that look in his eyes that is unique to him. Work on it. Respect for trying though.   Awesome work! You should post it to /r/Art  Share this on Quora.  Beside the scarf and beard, it looks nothing like him. Nose is wrong, mouth is wrong, face shape is wrong, eyebrows are wrong, it's all fucking wrong, lol. Face is flat as fuck.. you couldn't even get the shape of his head right. My guess is that you spend longer looking at the painting than you do looking at the subject matter. Where are the man's cheekbones? You robbed him. My Uber driver!",Non-Political

"A young poor kid offering a part of her meager meal to an elderly dog. I took this photo in one of the biggest temples in West Bengal. In the entire temple, this scene was the one of true devotion.  /u/NormieRey619  I wanted to gild you but instead of that why don't you pick a charity of your choice and I will donate Rs. 1000 to them. :) The saddest thing I ever saw in my life was a young beggar girl in Goa with a pet kitten. The girl was so tiny and cute, as was the kitten. They both were completely oblivious to everything around them and were just playing with each other.

Broke my heart to know that she had so little chance at a good life. That’s why we say that every child is God like. Dakshineshwar? Reminds me of a quote I read on a wall of a temple.

""Children are Gods on Earth, Worship them with Education.""

Can you believe it ? On a temple wall. Hurts to look at it. Who the fuck is downvoting....this should be way much higher That brought a tear in my eye ""জীবে প্রেম করে যেই জন, সেই জন সেবিছে ঈশ্বর।""

— Swami Vivekananda

&#x200B;

Translation: The one who loves living beings is the one serving God. ""Offering"" money to some carved peices of rocks is not devotion. Being happy in making others happy is the real one. As an atheist I see so much food being offered in holy places rather the. Distributing it among the needy I hope you actually gave the girl something to eat and didn't just take the pic for your photographic purposes. Elderly dog - that sounded so humane. Absolutely touching !! Lovely, deep moment...  I wonder if she has befriended the dog and considers it a valuable relationship...  💗 This! Now tell me where the real god is? Is god residing in those statues in the temple or in this kid? Only the poor can understand the pain of hunger . Can ya take the kid and fix it up ? Bless her heart Absolutely true, what appwerful picture! That’s why you need to be rich from heart and not from money. ♥️ Poorer you are by money, richer you are by heart. I see mostly the stray dogs around my place are fed by poor people. They also welcome stray dogs to take shelter near them when it rains Beautiful Superb shot What a way to start the day. Great job OP There is so much good that we can do to make the life of all the people on this earth a little better. 

It really breaks my heart to see someone who doesn't know that if they will get tonight's dinner or not. Its not like that everyone of us are so mean that we don't care and wont do anything for them. 

I see people care, then also we are unable to really help them.

If I am not sure of my food and shelter I get daunted to death. There, He's right outside the temple, friends. Don't go seeking inside for the God. Even the dog can't believe the purity lol. this is why people who can’t afford to have children shouldn’t have them tbh. So sad to see poor kids go hungry. Absolutely This picture made me emotional! Bless this kid ❤️ Pictures like this remind me there is good in humankind. Humanity still exists she will go to heaven and the dog will greet her when she arrives. Even, a rich guy fails to do. Lots of love on her. The word human is derived from humane
She is a true human👧 So well written man It is things like these that reinforces my belief in humanity . Thank you for the post protecc!! Jai maa kali ☺️ That's why I'm a atheist Indian

People waste tonnes of milk and other food stuff in the name of God yet they can't just see this picture Please post this in r/pics Love🙏🏻 r/humanporn You posted this pic on insta na? nice one Bhagwan ka roop. Sigh ....bless that lil girl...🙏🙏 And you just take a picture? How is this devotion? Not all empathy, compassion, and generosity needs to be attributed to religion, especially not in the case of a young child.

This indeed is inspiring. Vande Mataram! Do people normally salute the flag like this? Genuinely curious.  My father is a teacher. Almost same happened in his School too.

 send the pick to fuckers in RSS-BJP  Some parts of Bengal is under the flood water too. A big salute to all 4. Very emotional pic!! This is stupid. People who fought for Independence did it to save life of Indians and this guys are celebrating it just by killing themselves.  
 As a person who has always preferred sleeping till noon instead of attending Independence/republic day functions, I want to ask:- Why tho? I had done extensive medical relief work in 2008 Kosi floods of Bihar. The floods are devastating. These people have to wade through waste deep waters to reach school. This is not something to be proud of.

EDIT: One kid died after swimming back home. I hope People will get endless satisfaction and likes now.  What the fuck are they so proud about? People are like battered house wives that water nasty Am I the only one worried about them and not feeling patriotic for once? Like I get the seriousness of the picture and the problems they face but seriously? Is saluting a flag more important than saving those 2 children almost at drowning levels? I don't like this. Wet salute. Jai hind. A true love for motherland India. Feeling proud ! Jai Hind!  I am proud of those four Indians who won't forget Independence, even in despair.  Am I supposed to feel proud or something? Just in case Bhakts ask them whether they are true nationalists or not when they complain about floods Do it or get lynched.

"[P] what the fuck are we doing? the government have banned Porn, Reddit, Pub-G, even live leak & many more website! we should immediately take action now edit: extremely sorry for the obscene language & improper formatting *liveleak *pubg i posted this in rage

 i think we should immediately take action against this because it seems like government is trying to ban all non biased new sources Yep, Only way to beat china is to become china. We need to do something but the problem is we're a pretty small community and not many people use reddit in India and we can't rely on the media that's for sure, last time the whole net neutrality went viral cuz some influential youtubers like AIB made a PSA about it we could tweet them but I doubt that would work and petitions are pretty much useless, the only way for others to notice this is spreading this news on Instagram and Facebook. Society is ~~2 meals~~ 2 chicken dinners away from collapse. India needs something like ACLU (www.aclu.org). They stand up for violation of rights of individuals and society irrespective of how small/big you are. In turn common people donate to it regularly to keep the lights on. We need someone big who would find fight consistently on all violation of rights. \>government lets cow vigilantes loose in the streets, rewrites history to suit it's fascistic needs and obliterates cash currency to win elections.

\>government bans my spankbank, shitposting site and Unity Asset based Battle Royale game

Real shit.

GAMERS RISE UP. pubg is not banned by government. it is the commisioner of Rajkot, Surat and Ahmedabad. when asked to them why the ban. They said this for exam going of 10th and 12th standard.

&#x200B;

No court will allow any cases of pubg.  In rajkot it self they caught 7 students and file report and then freed them just to prove a point. but if they would have gone to court. court would have fucked the comimisioner as this is brasen misuse of power by comiisioners. I said it in another thread. I will say again, We 'The Internet' gotta do something about this before elections. We're over 190k here on reddit. Can't we do some shit to make it reachable to the whole country. If people can hack fucking printers to show 'Subscribe To Pewdiepie', then heck we can do some shit like that too. Indians on Internet should go for vendetta against gov and this IT cell fuckers.



**Edit:** Some are pointing what are the options? The easiest thing is to trend hashtag on twitter till news site will catch up. But IT cell is dominant over there too so it can be difficult. 

Change.org won't do shit. Leave it. One user asked to post and ask for help from /r/pewdiepiesubmissions . Which sounds like a good idea. As the chances are that pewdiepie will notice it and it could get international momentum to put some net neutrality pressure on our gov.



**EDIT 2:** Ok, submitting to pewds is what all are agreeig upon. We gotta preplanned for this strategy. Instead of posting multiple times. Please make one post only and help it achieve momentum as quickly as possibe. If someone want to post, please mention the time to post. If i'll post. I will do it tommorrow at 9.00 pm according to indian time. Chaliye Net Neutrality ko vanakkam I don't care about porn and pubg but if they ban Reddit on my phone, I'll riot. Aag lga dege BC. I see that the PUBG ban notification is for between Mar 14 and Mar 28 in Ahmedabad and Mar 9 to April 30 in Rajkot. Is it exam season right now? Probably police commissioners son/daughter/nephew/niece is addicted.

&#x200B;

&#x200B; we are unofficially a surveillance state When did the government ban Reddit?I missed it. Undeclared Emergency? > we should immediately take action now

Wow. Porn and Pubg has finally brought that revolution which even poverty and unemployment couldn't! Fascism 101 REDDIT IS BACK UP ON VODAFONE MUMBAI If ISPs are blocking sites without orders from the DoT, doesn't that violate Net Neutrality?  What is Pub-G? Please call your ISP...see what they say first...urge them to fix this ...The more people that complain directly, the better it is for us. Rather than complain on reddit, complain to your ISP. Call since i doubt they will reply to emails. By any chance Mukesh Ambani is launching jioVPN? Sad thing is govt won't put effort to stop more serious issues like crime . find a girlfriend - no need for porn.

you see son, you cannot keep blaming others for your problems. VPNs, I2P, TOR. Proxies, DNS, even HAM fucking radio. 

Tell people about these things. 

And for god sakes, people, use Signal.  Apna time ayega Youtube is next #SaveInternet This whole reddit ban controversy is definitely not countrywide. I can access everything except porn on all of my ISPs.  Nahi bc ye bkl facebook nahi ban karenge jisme sabse jyada cyipa Bhara pada hai. juggi jhopdi Wala bhi aaj facebook par hai  Chai piyo Reddit banned?

Still working though.

But I agree, people don't care about things in India man. Online privacy? Or privacy in general? Fuck off. Government says agencies can snoop on us without a warrant, fuck off.

We just don't care.

Yes, dare someone steal our fucking money, then we'll be out on the streets. VIVA LE REVOLUTION !!!! Koi bhosdiwala steam ban hone ki news fela ra tha kya yeh sach hai dosto/mitro ??  Mera Nazi Bharat ࿘ Mahan. How do we take action against this??
Next election we don't vote for BJP or a change.org petition or whatever it takes.. Wait?? Reddit, really? Is your government that retarded?? I think the saddest part is, India is a two party country, and such stupid policies will be made by other parties too.

We can and probably _should_ vote out BJP, but at what cost? Congress led alliance will maybe take some populist methods early to get approval from the people, but we will still be led by leaders who care firstly about themselves, next for their family and friends and never about the country or its people.

What is the solution? *Be more politically active* . India is at the cusp of a great intellectual revolution. We can make all the jokes about Superpower by 2020 thing, but we _are_ going to be a superpower very soon. The youth of the country is a very powerful thing. It is high time we take a more active role in how our country is governed.
 Please rebel your government is shit Even cloud.mail.ru is banned.  It looks like trump army are here. Don't you guys have anything to do beside posting off topic & hate comments?  Wow. r/India is on drugs. 

If some random commissioner misuses his powers, it's government's fault.

If supreme court bans porn, it's government's fault.

If an ISP decides to ban Reddit, it's government's fault. Banned Reddit, so what on the earth is this?

Edit: PubG is still on playstore, what's up with that? So what do you guys say ?
For god sake Don't say change.org Is reddit actually banned? Cause I’m still able to access it without a VPN.  Wait Reddit is banned? The government has ran out of better things to do, what an irony, this is digital India where everything is banned. They can't stop rapes and useless rise of violence. But hey, let's ban pubg, it'll save families, and banning porn will stop making people rapists. Oh and reddit is for traitors, they need a better plan for it. This country is achieving greatness in utmost stupidity possible. Banning things never solve problem, it's the people who make decisions and it is unfair to punish everyone for a very few one's mistakes. If a Government does that then it's a start of building a failed state. Now they started arresting people for playing pubg

https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pubg-gujarat-ban-10-arrested-in-gujarat-for-playing-pubg-they-didnt-see-gujarat-police-coming-2007521?amp=1&akamai-rum=off I'm seeing news that people in some cities have been arrested for playing PUBG! Wtf?! And their mobile phones have been seized for ""investigation"" which we know by now is just a way for them to harass these people. Yay! We are India who is against the breach of ""authoritative"" China in South Asia. We hated the tyrannies who supported China and celebrated their fall in Maldives and Sri Lanka. Pakistan should not be allowed to exist because of their human rights violations in Balochistan and support to terrorism. We are the world's largest democracy where not only the leaders but their followers doesn't want freedom of speech. We are the country who lets the murders of journalists and cases of droughts to be overshadowed by weddings of celebrities. We are the people who will let 6% unemployment rate go unpunished because the opposition is not strong enough. We belong to a place who will donate crores to religious institutions and let the family of a policeman be hungry because he intervened in a mob killing in Bundelkhand. We are a population that celebrates cleaning up dirty tramps who live under a bridge because they look ugly




If my comment is seen by a minister or even some of my relatives, I will be surely branded as an Anti - Nationalist (as if we still need nationalism after 70 years of independence). I will be termed as a communist because somehow everybody is. I will be called Congressi (even though i fucking hate the INC). In short, I am not supposed to say anything against the ruling party cuz BJP = INDIA and nobody else belongs here one easy way is to donate to [internet freedom foundation](https://internetfreedom.in/). they are already working on this. they can do with donations and volunteers.  What if we organise digitally? 

If at a set day and time, everyone reaches out to TRAI, DoT, politicians and journalists on all social media platforms and their websites and keeps going until someone does something about it? Not does this harness the power of public opinion but if it’s coordinated, it might trend on Twitter and Facebook which would attract Indians who don’t know about reddit bit are frustrated by the situation. We should ask popular youtubers like Carryminati, BB etc. Even a minute from video their regarding this issue will be enough. Let's face it. Most Indians (at least the one who vote) prioritize caste and religion more than freedom of speech. And the fucking IQ is so low, i can just keep on going with examples Alas! India awakens at the stroke of the midnight hour. I solemnly swear to sit on a dharma at hantar mantar if they ban reddit! Yep. Totally agree that porn is the most reliable news source  Reddit banned???  Ye konsi webportal h jispr hum log post kr rhe h??  Same here in Iraq. If Reddit is banned, then how come u & me are using it? 

Do u have any circular saying that these are banned? Eagerly waiting for election day...😡 And what do you propose we do? I don't give two shits about pubgM, but seeing how it's pissing off all these uncle and aunty ji's is both hilarious and sad at the same time. 

Why the fuck do they care about what we play? It's better than watching all those stupid ass saas bahu serials and propoganda filled news channels. I don't mind as long as they don't ban pubg and youtube  Bhai abhi to shuru hua hai... Aane de abhi bar aur modi sarkar, ho kuch imagine nahi kara wo sab ho jana hai... It will all be restored right before the elections. Liveleak blocked?what?since when? All working for me without vpn... :)

But why Reddit? Did they give any reason?  Reddit isn't banned yet Even after all this, we can use VPNs to run these apps and sites. So what's the point of banning them?  That's why we got Tor Chaiwala sahi khel raha  Reddit? Since when? Why did they ban reddit??  PUBG kab ban hua? What a clickbait post - the porn ban was done by the courts and pubg was done by the police comm. 

Dafuq has Modi got to do with this OP? Can't we have a hash tag trending on twitter to make other segments aware as well? I think we have enough people to make a hashtag trending. What say? Reddit? Who banned reddit? And pubg? Those, if banned are not by the government but by local self governments. For porn, try pornhub.net Did they ""ban"" Reddit again? I know Hathway had blocked it a few days back but last I checked it was accessible again. Smh Okay guys, I'm on You Broadband. It was blocked since morning, I just checked and reddit isn't blocked anymore.. God, I am seriously frustrated with this dumb-fuck of a country!! :/ Are we sure this wasn't due to the outages affecting facebook, insta, etc? [change.org](https://change.org) may work? Dont think govy has outright banned Reddit. Current outage was some behind the scenes job. In fact, reddit is back online now on my phone. It is no longer unreachable in browser or app. reddit ban??? But why Reddit?
Only intelligent ppl are on it and they don’t vote anyway 😄😄 **We need to make Moral Policing/Surveillance an election issue…**


The India that I was taught growing up was considered to be a diverse pluralistic democracy that allows for freedoms of identity and expression. Yet, it is utterly shameful that the political parties begging for our votes either don't bother about our ability and freedom to express ourselves or worse trample upon them with impunity. 

This starts with beef and then porn and then discussion sites like Reddit and goes to even the games you play on your mobile phone. It seems like Indian culture mainly is other people telling you how to live your life and there is no room for people to disagree with them. Everyone needs to live this nice 'Sanskari' life where the sanskars are just what they consider right and any other kind of life will not be allowed. 

The worst part is we have an election coming in less than a month or two and issues like our social rights and freedoms aren't even being taken that seriously. We are a democracy with a population largely under 25 and the youth wings of these political parties have a severe disconnect from reality as evident from the Ramya AMA last week. The BJP obviously doesn't give a shit about your social issues and the opposition parties don't seem to care either. This is probably because they are focused on farmer votes and subsidies and concessions. We need to show these political parties that there is a large substantial urban population that is extremely unhappy with their moral policing and daddy-state surveillance strategies. How many times have we read of a bunch of people getting arrested for things they said on Facebook or Whatsapp or elsewhere and ignored it? Have we gotten used to and are we okay with this happening? Why would they ban reddit ? Instead of Twitter Facebook and Instagram . seeing this from the popular page, living in america. wtf is going on over there?? this is very worrying to me, it looks like chinese levels of censoring from this little bit Is this constitutional? I don't think it is....why can't any one challenge it? bUt nO OnE iN iNDiA USe rEdDiT PUBGM Wait what? PUBG is banned? Wait is reddit banned? I am currently using it normally Whats live leak? Reddit is working on Vodafone Mumbai again, for me atleast

Edit: not anymore I am able to access all the website. Nothing is blocked by my ISP.  Collegehumor, Reddit. Not playing PUBG and hence don’t know about it  They banned reddit? Being a leftist is a very bad deal in India, for example, almost everyone hates Arundhati Roy just because she raised her voice against Modi for 2002 riots, unfair relocation of tribal people for construction of dams and many more things. We have this perception of 'mera Bharat mahan' that we fail to even wonder 'what if it's not?', nobody questions this fascist government, cuz the media feeds us news about the achievements but not the shortcomings. Maybe we should focus on things that we can achieve rather than dwellings on things we have already achieved.  God damn it... I am super frustrated about this... they don’t ban bad stuff like alcohol but ban Porn? I don’t want to buy a freaking vpn service for this... but nobody cares do they? If we all come together, we can do something about this.









Edit: rage comment. Point What about paying customers for Porn? If they can’t open the site to cancel the subscription, they are done. I am not an addict personally, but I don’t want India to become the country that blocks everything. I thought we are in a pretty good shape considering Spotify and YouTube Premium arrived here, but apparently not. Government, are you listening? You are aren’t you? DO SOMETHING PEOPLE... They banned Porn for what reason? Why did they block Reddit? Because it contains NSFW? So the government doesn’t contain humans apparently... By any chance is your ISP jio? That could be the answer r/nofap bros

&#x200B; Kim Jong Un approves These politicians want us to be as dumb and boring as them. Hence these bans.  Reddit? But how exactly we can show our frustration to the government. I dont think government will look in it until it affects them. Perhaps the only thing you can do, and SHOULD do is vote.

Please don't forget to vote.

It won't change anything, he'll be back and things will get worse. But at least you won't blame yourself for not doing your part. Anything we as a community can do? Will a twitter campaign atleast bring attention to the issue? May not solve the problem itself, I agree. But may be it will grab the attention of some eminent lawyers, the ones who file PILs in SC for actual ""public interest"".  Achhe Din (TM)  Twitter is also blocked Has the government even thought of banning Whatsapp, the main source of fake news channel?? Kya action le sakte haiṅ? Koi hai portal toh bolo. Nahi toh apna khud ka Internet banaa lo. America mein bhi kissi ne banaaya tha ek community ke liye.  RW trolls are okay with this? 

I assume they watch porn and a lot of them are here ruining reddit - if some of the RW crowd is not okay with this, we could pursue them to make a noise about this. 

BJP is not going to listen to anti-nationals/libtards/commies but might listen to the demands of its own cadres. 

At the end of the day, whether you are left wing or right - everyone does hasthmaithun.  I am with partial ban against PUBG because i have a cousin studying in boards he plays too much of it.

Also he beats me at it.  *the government has Sbb khtm ho chuka hai
 You guys should get your porn fix the old old way. Visit Khajuraho and similar temples. Read the classics, Kathasaritsagar as far as I remember was particularly hot. Mahabharata a little less so. Always go for the original unexpurgated translations and not the Tulsidas-ified versions. \#Riseup on Twitter and write what the fuck is wrong. in this democratic country to make to trending. People will notice us. Just try like the metoo movement wait they banned reddit wtf ? I am able to access it just fine on Airtel. Maybe some particular dumbass ISP banned it.  Government: bans Reddit and PUBG.
my VPN: This is America! BSNL, the one who hasn't banned all this, is literally State-owned enterprise, and you say the government has banned? It would make sense for the ban to begin from an enterprise that is under the ambit of the government lmao 

the logic would put a 5 year old to shame
 Why are you extremely sorry for the obscene language ? This is fuckin internet you can say whatever the fuck you want. 

And for ban Buy a VPN or use a free one. Maybe to begin with - https://internetfreedom.in
Folks who aren't in the country (like me) can donate, folks within the country can volunteer! Just twitter viral it by \#Riseup or whatever decide the slogan and make the post on reddit we will trend on Twitter. A twitter take over I can access Reddit on my Idea 4g network. When did It get banned? What s the solution? Rg? None of these bans are going to survive constitutional challenge.  Long live Shreya Singhal.  We can do something but I am pretty sure they find out it originated on reddit guess what they will  justify the ban on reddit or make it even harsher or even worse normies would swarm reddit making it like Facebook or Instagram and then we will have a voice that they would ridicule. r/india is a  small community and it is rather easy to be tagged a anti national in this country we need to do something but reddits name should not come into it. ya wo pubg wala ha kya ?

&#x200B; some way it a good decision the porn ban was due to **120% growth** in people watching porn when jio came and jio ban was as you can see all the **students wasting time** in this game there are both side of a coin the source for jio [https://qz.com/india/1187963/jio-beta-cheap-data-is-fuelling-a-porn-boom-in-india/](https://qz.com/india/1187963/jio-beta-cheap-data-is-fuelling-a-porn-boom-in-india/) > it seems like government is trying to ban all non biased new sources

Our little coordinated efforts can go a long way. Our movement will gain some traction as media houses start noticing it. I’ve been away from the country for a few years now. Can someone give me a brief context of this? I know porn websites have been banned but why Reddit and PubG? Is it banned on all networks (airtel/vodafone etc)? It’s a good thing that they banned porn, every country should follow the same example yea sure.

I also remember the air hostess absolutely losing her shit and screaming at the passengers 🤣 Gets me every time. Why do people care so much about exiting when we're all gonna take the same transit bus!  Used to think it's an Indian thing. Now that I've seen it everywhere it's just.

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ I thought it was only Indians who did this but after travelling in the US and Europe I can say that it's a universal problem. It's a global pandemic. From first world nations to third world. Been on many international flights. It's the same everywhere. The only thing that stands out here is all these men shoving their dicks up their neighbors. Personal space isn't an Indian concept. Ha ha.. this sucks. But I want to point out something - these are the people who did not grow up flying. Most of them probably took their first flight a couple of years ago. Hence, learning civic sense will take some time. Also, at this age, I don't expect them to adapt to new things as fast as us youngsters could. Their habits still follow them from the era where they have to fight for a bus or train seat - so cut them some slack. A country where everyone is in a hurry but no one's on time.  At least people are not trying to cut the line and get ahead of each other !  If you want indians to stand during national anthem in movie theaters just show them a video of an aeroplane landing
-abhi Bc inko to 8000 feet upar se hi utar dena chahiye. That happens here in South Africa as well. It’s human nature I guess.  a random guy: bhaisaab aap next stop me utar rahe ho?  Why does everyone in India is devoid of basic etiquette ? 

We don't hold door, never say ""sorry"" or ""excuse me"". 

Talk loudly in public

Spit and urinate anywhere

&#x200B;

Fuck these people ! Same shit everywhere even in USA. People are too impatient Not unique to India by any means... Am I the only one who's never had a bad flight experience? I mean sure it got delayed and all, but I never saw anyone with bad etiquettes. Couple years back I went to Nepal with a team of people and boarding the flight from Nepal was insane. One of our members was pregnant and nobody was being considerate when moving around her. Some people would actually hold on to your head instead of the chair to support themselves getting into their seat. And the boarding process itself was a mess too. After the initial waiting they have you file into another room when the plane lands and cram everyone in there till it is time to board. And then there is one last ""security check."" As everyone is trying to get out of the room at the same time to walk to the plane, women have to go through one door and men the other (it's a double door exit so people were mobbing to get out) for a ""pat down"".  I like being the last person to get off the plane. It's relaxing. Sometimes, when I have to catch a transfer flight that i'm already late for, this gets very annoying. A lot of them are arriving at their final destination but still cause a traffic like they're in a hurry.  I do it to stretch my legs after a long flight. I do this. We're stretching our legs after an 8 hour flight! It’s feels so good to Just stand up after being crammed into those tiny seats for hours,  This is common in every country Enough with the self-loathing. This happens in literally every single flight to and from everywhere. It has nothing to do with the Indians.   You know who I hate? Those idiots who keep trying to use the phone even after the attendant says please turn off the FUCKING PHONE! That's weak, I've seen people taking out their handy bags while the plane is landing, legit 3 guys fell down when the plane made contact with the ground😂😂 Wow look at me, I saved 2 minutes in a 3 hour flight by standing up early and making a hustle. The death glare you get when you're on the aisle seat and don't up early. See, in Mumbai local trains stop only for 5-10 seconds at stations; so this is just practice.  Good thing it’s not Air India because at least you know for sure that your plane will land and just fall up part mid flight Can’t you see they’re important? Have some respect Mexico? Is that you? Whatever are you doing in India? I once saw a man getup and walk towards the front as soon as the plane took off. He did not even have a bomb or a weapon, he just wanted to sit with his friend. The scolding he got from the air-hostess was hilarious.   This is what happens when a whole generation grows up being taught to queue up in assembly everyday in school.  Didn't you know ? First person out of the jet gets a green card ..  I’m ashamed to admit it but I do the same sometimes. In my defense, the passport control at the Indra Gandhi International is always too long. And if I were to take my time to leisurely get off the plane, I’d be stuck in an even longer line than I would’ve if I had rushed.  In conclusion, get more staff for the passport control! People grow old but don't understand little things. When i try to get off the metro at a station there will already be people rushing to get on. Let me get off u twats. Sorry guys, but this is not unique to India. I live on mainland USA, and for the last few years I've noticed the early stand up and shuffle to try and be first off the plane getting worse across the globe... Worth a watch.

Honest Indian Flights - 
https://youtu.be/4fOaW6A4j5E I can literally see all that BO. Calm down guys, it's not just us Indians. It's an universal thing! This happens across the world. It’s not exactly time consuming to get the stairs on a bigger plane if you don’t deplane into the tube thing that connects to the terminal. Queuing (without pushing and shoving people) just  helps deplane faster. If you are a frequent flyer and seated in the first few rows of Domestic economy or fly Business/First, you will still get your hand baggage off the bin and stand to deplane after you are sure landing is complete because it is efficient to do that, especially if you don’t have checked in baggage. 

Sometimes , you book meetings tight and it makes sense to get off and find a ride or drive to the place you must be at quickly. 

There is also a flip side. Just to paint the picture - Frankfurt business class security took 2 hours to clear because it was a long weekend. I only planned on some food in the lounge before boarding, else I’d not have got to the airport that early. 


One more because  I’m an Indian national.  I missed a connection in Frankfurt, again. This was because there are a bunch of flights from 10 - 12 noon local time to DEL, MUM, BLR, etc and one guy decided to lie he was also catching the BLR flight because he feels it is fun to claim to be a ‘boss traveller with a loud voice’  when a bunch of us travellers were ploughing through the queue to make a BLR flight. People shoved us back given how crowds work and didn’t let us go through - 5 of us, 2 non Indians and 3 Indians missed the flight because of this asshole. I didn’t have a visa to re-enter EU and had to pay by the hour to stay the night to catch the next plane the following day. Whoever that filthy fuck that went on a company paid trip and pretended to fly the plane that route everyday, I hope the worst happens to you for being a liar at the cost of everyone else. Please don’t be selfish, fellow humans. Let other people through on tight connections.  

Also, it’s okay to stand up and get your bags once the plane has landed as long as you don’t inconvenience anyone.  This happens not just in India. We can't judge it man. I took plane only once and I did that because my father died and I wanted to go to as fast as I can.  Sadly this isn't only confined to India. I've seen people behave like this on domestic flights all over the US as well.  Imagine meeting your future gf on this plane and she gets up as soon as the plane lands Probably unpopular opinion, but while I used to despise this earlier, I do this because it feels good stretching your legs after a long flight. Getting out early helps to avoid long queue at immigration I get why people are upset about this. Maybe Indians should be more patient while getting off the plane. Honestly I used to feel the same until I started thinking differently. 

Maybe we do it because we want the maximum out of our time. Maybe we are sick and tired of the plane crawling on the tarmac for 20 minutes after it has landed. Maybe our airports need to be faster. Eagerness to reach their homes, coupled with the uncertainty of when the plane will stop moving so that they can get down, causes them to stand up so that they can atleast cut down on the few minutes that are ""under their control"". I think we need to stop making such a big deal out of this issue and cut everyone some slack.

Edit: and honestly, such posts on r/india that target desis seem like a cheap attempt at gaining karma(which is meaningless, coz this isn't stackexchange). to an eternal wait for check-in luggage If you’re frequent cattle-class flyer, you will find this mildly relaxing. Ye local train wale hain. I used to expect stewardesses pull all them ears and tell them to sit down but even they’ve given up. Better for their mental peace  Everyone is in a hurry, but nobody reaches on time No stampede? usually see this on trains. seeing for the first time on an airplane Rare pic Indians preferring to stand in line I hope the plane had finished taxiing. And why are they getting off the other end? Do planes in India deboard from the rear door too? I am a Indian after all 


Don't put yo blame on me  LOL, you cannot mistake the country from that photo :-) A bomb is ticking ! I have been heckled by “uncles” many a Times whenever I fly Mumbai-Bengaluru route when I’m in India. I have now wised up and pay for a window seat so I can be in peace :( it's good that you're at the window seat lol... the aunty sitting next to me asked me to get up and move when i was sitting at the aisle seat once...   


  
and then she took her luggage and sat down -----\_\_\_\_\_\_-----  
 why are they moving the other way? No matter how many flights Indians take, the ‘bus’ mentality can never leave.  Its like a competition to anyone who gets out the plane first :( I believe Indians are habitual of standing in lines. if they've landed in Delhi i bet they're hurrying to get some fresh air outside  You can get people out of sarkari bus but you cannot get sarkari bus out of people Ohh my! This comment section...🤣🤣🤣 r/mildlyinfuriating  All of it is a race! Maybe some have a connection? Anyone know what’s up with the headrest art?
   They're all just taking a shit in the aisle, nothing out of the ordinary ""I am in a hurry to get out of the plane. I'll see you at the luggage belt"" Every. Fucking. Time. This is casual India It happens every where.. Is this a local or international flight? And why do I see only men in the line? There is almost same situation in intercontinental flights when it lands in India. 😉 I don’t leave my seat and don’t even let my companion leave. I like to believe that 2 person at a time but I am making Indian traveller more discipline.  Even in USA people get off plane quickly as the disabled or people requiring help(medical or otherwise) get off last. The faster you eveacuate better for them.  IT'S EVERYWHERE/ ALSO IN GERMANY  Lol let them stand if they like. I'd rather sit and relax while they hug and dry hump each other for 10 minutes and then leave when no one is around to shove into my personal space.  This is not exclusive to the Indians I was the one who gets off last and has a nice chat with hostesses “Sir, SIR, please remain seated.”
 This happens pretty much all across Asia Have you seen the lines at customs and immigration in Mumbai?? I would be standing up ready to run my ass out of there too! That's how India works  Yeah, but...it KINDA makes sense to stand up in a narrow line along the aisle, right? Your legs are so cramped, especially when you’re in the back of the plane and in coach (which I am). HURRY UP AND GET IN LINE SO WE CAN WAIT AND GET TO OUR NEXT WAIT FASTER! Same story goes for train 45 mins before your station arrives And then they'll go and stand at the baggage belt for 20 minutes!😄 This can be managed by the crew themselves.  I stand up early and join the queue even I know I shouldn't but I join the queue otherwise I have to wait everyone to pass along the queue , ironic but better to stand than wait One guy told me he wanted to leave the plane early so He cannot exchange the seat  with me. 

It was a 10 hour flight to India.  I'm from Brazil and the same thing happens in here. Oh boy, they will often open the baggage holder and take their stuff ASAP and leave your shit there. If you are sitting at the corridor, get ready to be mean looked by the people next to you. I don't know what to do and why people do this. This infuriates me a lot. Its the utmoat failure and disgrace of the human race. REMAIN AT YOUR SITS UNTIL ITS TIME TO LEAVE THE PLANE YOU MASSIVE HORDE OF IGNORANT SWINES.

Rant over. You guys at India are cool though.  This is plane stupid.. Jor se bolo  We Indians never let anybody down. Neither ourselves nor anybody else.

Good to see us at work ! Happens every time.  I bet the plane was still moving.  No matter how much you get hurry....the luggage only comes after 30 min! There are a few reasons for doing this especially for Indians:

1. If you have got semi-fragile item in your hand luggage and you have placed it far away from your seating because the space above your seat was already taken. There is a fear that people would shove it around cause damage. This in turn is also the reason for queuing up immediately for boarding.
2. The time it takes for luggage claim and immigration.
3. If you sitting in the aisle seat, the person/s beside you won't stop staring until you get up or insists you let them pass even when there is no space. This is why I hate seating in the aisle. I remember the last time I was in a flight I kept sitting after the plane landed and the people beside me were asking me ""Arrey aapko utarna nahi kya?"" (Aren't you getting off the plane?). It was raining outside and the crew had announced that everyone be seated for a bit as they didn't want everyone to be submerged. I didn't get up though hehe 😈 Up roadways Love just sitting there and bobbing my head to music while the sheep look at me weirded out as to why I am not standing in line with them. ""Do you not know they give you 60 seconds to get off the plane and if you miss that, you will be dropped at the next stop!"" Is it only me or they look very stupid? This isn't particularly an Indian thing tbh. I remember watching a Brian Regan bit about people crowding during the boarding process like it's the last helicopter out of Vienna.

Something about air travel just makes people stupid. I feel bad for you if you travel by Spicejet

&#x200B; Mumbai local train  Maza AATA hai... Ragadne me In India I just wait and deplane last.

Just easier that way rather than trying to argue with uncles. I don't get why people do this tbh Its a cycle. The sooner you get out, the faster you can exit the airport and quicker you will get your cab, which will be able to get out of the airport queue faster. In short people try to avoid the bottlenecks of traffic etc. Frequent fliers know this and by deboarding quickly you can save 30mins easily, which is very crucial when you're catching a morning flight for office work. When planes become Kokkata Metro Happens everywhere As the son of a pilot I have been brought up with waiting for the doors to open before you get up. Why stress your way out when you still have to wait for the luggage by the transport band People who pay more for the front row seats get doomed by all the back seat passengers pushing forward. 
That's why I never pay extra for front rows  So like every other flight in India ever?  I do this, but only on international flights. Judge away ! At the end of a 20 hour flight, most of us are tired, hungry, and we want to get home ASAP.

But, the immigration queues at an American airport are no joke. So, in my opinion, no harm in trying to deplane early. The country has always been out of control.  Can't take the medieval mindset out of ""modern"" people no matter how hard you try. Always in a hurry to leave but never on time for an appointment..!! Sigh, Indians..!! Something is seriously wrong with Indian behavior. They have no sense of personal space, litter everywhere, and have issues communicating. Can someone explain why we Indians do some of these embarrassing things ""unconsciously"" ?  this is so pathetically territorial  They probably haven't even landed yet. Doesn't it actually feel great to stand up and stretch after a long flight? I don’t understand why this is bad or a problem. I get up because I’ve been sitting for 4 hours and I’m in pain. Sorry that it bothers you. Tyyyyyyyyyypical Indians... I believe this behaviour is a shadow of something deeper in all of us Indians. The rush to get anything done in the least amount of time. I could be wrong, but I noticed a pattern among NRI friends to not do this as much as my Indian residential friends. This behavior is almost a sure indication of

1. Infrequent traveler
2. Total disdain for etiquette or rules
3. How much we really think is fair to others
4. The thinking that 'if I benefit this minute by saving a minute, do I really care for anything else? Nope'.

98% of these people are still going to wait for their bags at the carousels and that will not change their final arrival time. Even if it's their 3rd or 4th flight and know that for a fact, this nonsensical behavior of jumping up with the crowd continues... Judgemental pricks, I want to stretch my legs after a cramped flight get over it r/trashy  Old habits die hard. This is the habit from back when they were riding buses and trains. Same thing in movie theater, buses, planes, ships.. Indians do like leave fast, hope some do this in real life too.. ;)  It is very common even in the ‘developed’ countries. 

When you’ve been sitting for a long time, it’s very natural to want to stand up. Sitting in those cramped seats isn’t a pleasant experience and I guess everyone would agree to that.  Hippity hoppity  Ahh what's the best thing to do after a 10 hours flight? Remain seated?  What here is strange? Sitting is generally bad for one’s health. What’s 
more, flying increases the risk of of pulmonary embolism, and remaining sedentary for an unnatural number of hours on top of that, is a frequent cause-of-death. So many people are triggered upon seeing this picture. It could well be that they value their time much more than you lazy asses. Few minutes are all that matters in so many situations. It could be a business meeting, a date, a class to take, desire to meet a loved one asap, another flight to catch, exercise minded people, people restless to stretch their legs, people wanting more oxygen, people unable to hold their shit, It can be anything, but why is randia getting so condescending over this. The joke is on you guys. These are perhaps people like me who like to stand even when there are seats available And will stand at ever opportunity available. Baa dum tsss!!! What can you expect from people travelling in Spicejet",[R]eddiquette
"Inside Mysore Palace. [1080*1168] [OC] [Redmi Y2]  [Shot a similar pic last month](https://i.imgur.com/Orxr7Q2.jpg) Photography is prohibited inside the Palace. Some high profile kids got into  serious trouble for doing a photoshoot inside. 

If you take pictures, dont post on social media sites. Woah it has some optical illusion going-on on the floor Please post this in r/incredibleindia post it at r/pics DMT palace you mean? ;p Imagine walking down this lane while being high. I went here as a kid, other than the photos as proof I barely remember it. Need to go there once again. We went on a Sunday in December 2018. My companion, who'd been there before, was surprised to see visitors freely photographing the Palace from inside and not being asked to refrain from doing so. So I suppose they've relaxed the rules. I went there on a class trip in 2007 and an artist was repainting the work on the columns. In my broken Hindi I asked if I could help him and he let me. But was unable to get a picture of me painting because of the photography restrictions. afaik clicking pics is prohibited inside that palace. The inside of my sore place looks way......shittier This beauty is unparalleled Hey OP, saw that glass window which looks like nothing is there? On the 1st floor? Where? Beautiful indeed thanks OP Mysore Palace is really beautiful. Great aperture with this phone's camera looking with the picture capability... Nic pic.

Pristine and well maintained legacy ! Nice Palace. i liked it. i love to explore this kind of places. +1 for taking care of the symmetry. Wow this is really beautiful.. love the symmetry Looks like there renovations are finally done. Have to plan a visit soon! 
Beautiful pic OP 👍 Looks like an optical illusion 😅 Omg India is so beautiful Let's see how you make your way outside! great Wow! So Amazing Beautiful. that is so beautiful. Nice pic pal r/trippy r/pics breathtaking /r/ArchitecturePorn It looks awesome WOW.... Wow been there but my pictures are not like this. You should see inside Mysore ass. o: Photography isn't allowed in there mate. 

Delete this post Once upon a time there was great India Mysore 😍 All of you complaining about the processing this has gone through. It doesn’t matter as long as it looks good to the person who shot it. 
Bumping up the exposure and saturation on this gives it life and just look at it as a form of artistic expression. Peace. Great picture buddy 👌🏽 can’t believe it was taken on a mobile phone.

Great work 👍🏽 https://youtu.be/PTqtrGBYpxQ Kinda hate that everyone who took pictures at this spot in Mysore Palace have 'cut-out' the first arch from the frame. Why -_- Wow!! this beauty is awesome. Really our India is incredible. Fantastic pic. OMG! That looks absolutely stunning... Simply amazing!! Put it on /world subreddit. Let the world know! So now a dslr is replaceable by a ₹8499 phone. How does it smell in there? These designs are cool but they look stolen/inspired from European cathedrals..",Photography
"Great idea sirji!!  Lol I don't think these contractors give a shit. They are openly corrupt and even show off about it... At least, they should have a board put up somewhere with the contractor's company and proprietor name written. If you are building a road with Lakhs, you can spend a couple of thousand on a small sized bill-board. holy fuck, /r/india has 81k subscribers now? man, last time I checked (which was admittedly quite a long time back), it was only around 33k or so. no wonder more threads have 1000+ upvotes (despite the altered upvoting algorithm) blacken photo too doode :)

:P Probably a good idea to get the road quality to improve, but aren't we actually elevating a lowly corrupt weasel to a place meant for venerated individuals?  ""Hindustan Construction madharchoddddd"" Road names will change twice a year. They are built to last 6 months. Put there life on risk...they will fix your life of risk. my dad is in the army so i have seen many states/cities and their roads. Dehradun, Bikaner, Hyderabad, UP west (countrysides) have mostly very good roads. I cant even remember a city with quite a lot bad roads or maybe i am just lucky. But i can say that roads a decade ago were pathetic, i mean really really pathetic, those days roads in villages were a joke, made up of bricks, even plain earth was less bumpier than those old village roads. But still there's a LOT to improve in our roads and their safety, proper road signs everywhere are a must these days and govt should do something about it, but they won't. Still i would say improvement is there but there's a lot to do yet
 I live in a govt colony where people have a room extra constructed attached to the house . Contractors as a practice remake the constructed room every time a tenant leaves so they can make a weak structure and pocket up to 4 lakhs per house. Good living if you ask me , much better than slogging in private. Be me.

Drive to work.

Yell JKumar madarchod. HCC gandpakode. Relcon chutiye. RPS laude every day

Be totally less stressed. Instead, they can have the names of official who were responsible for approval of tender and inspection of work on each road. If the gatekeeper is afraid of implication, then he will do a better job. Can someone make an app , integrated with Google maps that shows who the contractor is. Many lives are lost due to poor roads these mofos have to be held accountable.  

There's a big Nexus between politicians and contractors in alloting/ renewing tenders. We should urge for transparency in this area.  Japan already does this. And, in fact if you do a shitty job there, they will put your photograph to shame you even further. A constant reminder that this person did a piss poor job on the project assigned to him.

That's probably one of the reasons their roads are in top shape.
Instead of revolting/criticising an idea and finding just the cons with it, for once keep a positive outlook and see what happens rather than living on assumptions. It is already done in Bangalore but it is a company not the name of the contractor. Tendersure roads that is footpaths also have name of contractor(also company name). In the case of roads it has improved quality is doubtful. The roads are resurfaced every year, so obviously there are no pot holes, but this is unnecessary work as roads need to be redone only once in 5 years. People get good roads but their tax money is drained and wasted. Giving contract for say 20 years may be better, then they will try to reduce the material and work, but with some obvious cons. Hahaha... Wouldn't that be interesting! 

If it does happen, this will make contractors more wary about their quality. But that would make roads confusing Can we get the name of the contractor who built Mukesh Ambani's 'house' If road names had the road names of the person who built it shit would get very confusing very fast Corruption has reached an unacceptable level. It devours resources that could be devoted to the citizens. It impedes the proper carrying out of market rules and penalizes the honest and capable. One of the bigger reasons why our roads and a lot of our infra is in such a state: we are shameless. You can add contractor's name, he won't give a shit.  LOL - nice. please hear me out. I think it should be something our population ought to be reminded of like Logic road, Trust expressway, Honor walkway, Enlightenment ..., Dharma, Buddha,   Never got to experience bad roads in Chandigarh. 
 Chutiya idea. Road har 5 saal me naya contractor banayega, kaun yaad rakhega roads ke naam? Iska baap?

Translation: Pussyman idea :D 
Who will remember the road name, when get made by new contractor every 1-5 years? His dad?

Good living if you ask me , much better than slogging in private. My WhatsApp is leaking. It makes complete sense. Giving street address a whole new meaning.  क्या बात है!! Contractor's name + ki maa would be more effective.  Contractor ke ghar tak jaoge kaise, road ka to waat laga hoga Great idea sirji!! . Jab Naam hamare netao ke naam par rakha jata hai   to is baaat ka hamhe garv bhi hota hai 
contractor ka naam nahi waha ke local eniggner wahe ke DM SDM ka naam hona chahiye jisse kuch bhi problem hone par unhe call ki ja sake But many contractors are also politicians or power brokers. This would probably make them happy.

"Heartbreaking photograph. Indian Army officer consoling father of Lance Naik Nazir Ahmad of Kulgam in South Kashmir who sacrificed his life for the country while fighting terrorists recently. India salutes these sons of the soil in Kashmir who always put nation first. Prayers  ""Sabhi ka khoon mila hai yahan ki mitti mein

Kisi ke baap ka hindostaan thodi hai"" Alot of people are commenting that why his name and him being a kashmiri is mentioned. Is it not enough to mention that he's an Indian or jawan. This is the question raised everytime we see news like this (even cases where the caste of the victim is mentioned). It's not enough. The reason is until the killing is not done due to ones name/caste, this is important. It paints the picture that 'they' are also with us, fighting for us. 

I wanted others to see what I see. I know you guys who raise these questions might be neutral and only see his nationality or him being a human being, but don't assume that the whole of India does the same. In fact the majority of our people first want to know the name. Why? because names in most cases can identify a person's religion, caste, community, status, etc. 

I do understand the concern that such way of reporting emphasizes the difference. But the differences is there. It's not going to dissapear. I believe we should be teaching people that the difference is there but it doesnt matter. Example is we don't ignore male and female differences (its there) but those differences shouldn't matter in getting equal rights.

I do hope I make sense to some of you even though my comment is here and there. Thank you. Heartbreaking. It takes real courage to pick up a gun and fight for a people and an idea of India. We all sleep under the comfort and security that these heroes provide. I hope his father finds the courage to carry on even though his son is gone. Imagine burying your own child. It's unbearable. 


In my own way today I will try and honour this hero by doing my own work honestly and productively. Salute.  Army officer has a name too. [removed] Everybody will praise his courage but does anyone acknowledge real enemy?
Real enemy is army corruption and bureaucracy. We can have very less casualties if all allocated defense budget was honestly used on weapons, accessories and research. CMV? As a Kashmiri who had to run from his hometown because of terrorism, I salute brave officers like these who give their lives fighting against terrorism. And I hope & pray one day Kashmir will be peaceful again so us natives can go back again and live in peace and harmony. As an army kid in India who always finds herself at quits when defending the army presence ( especially w Afspa) and repercussions in Kashmir (having lived there), this brought tears to the eyes When Pakistani will understand this bloodshed! RIP Ahmad. Sad what you had to go through. 
While we are at it,  let's also pray for the pellet victims killed and injured by the Army. Let's pray for Hiba, 18 month old baby who was shot a pellet in her eye blinding her. 

Peace! Reddit really is Facebook now With all due respect to the family of the dead. Isn't this more of a whatsapp content.  touchy  This is the heartbreaking moment with the father and of his son. r/pics

"A role model for countless Indian women, Kalpana was an ordinary girl from Karnal whose lofty dreams and indomitable courage took her to space.  Countless Indian men too. She inspired me when I was a kid. Been a fan since a kid. Hope to make her proud someday. There is a chowk dedicated to her near my house. I was watching the command center updates and live video of the shuttle, just a few minutes before it exploded. You could really feel the emotions running through the people while they still maintain professionalism to get the job done. Here's a toast to everyone who is passionate about things that matter to them.  RIP Kalpana. You are a hero and a role model to many Indian girls. I met her father. He was tremendously bitter. Karnal is full of houses with old parents. Most leave behind theirs to craft a career for themselves. Different contexts. Different stories. Different heroes. [NASA's tribute page for Kalpana Chawla](https://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/archives/sts-107/memorial/chawla.html), with a short feature video before the STS-107 flight. theres a great podcast on the Space Shuttle Columbia on which Kalpana chawla was by Gimlet Media.

Link might not work so here is the name :

Undone : The Colombia Now this is EMPOWERMENT. Not some fake ass magazine advert. Finally some uplifting stuff on the Indian subreddit....Yay!!! Read the comments. Most are really bitter about who/why someone should be inspired by her or not.   


Can we all just take a moment to recognize the achievement of us (humans) as a whole. We started from the very absolute scratch and we can now send people to the moon and other planets. 

EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THAT SHUTTLE IS INSPIRING. They were on the edge and they knew it and they never came back.  

This led to better rocket designs and space-X and blue-origin etc etc. (in a grand universe sorta way)

&#x200B;

oh my heart!! <3 I personally knew and had the chance to work with K. C. during training for both STS-87 and STS-107. Although more than a decade has passed I still don’t care to articulate what a deep and profound sense of loss I feel for those astronauts. 

Edit: Reading this thread and the comments; the user remarks regarding K. C.’s choice to emigrate or marry an American are public fact but please keep your assumptions regarding her marriage or private life to yourselves – if you did not personally know her (based off the rather misogynistic and speculative comments).

On the topic, I will say – Indian women should be inspired and empowered. Kalpana was a tour de force in her own autonomy and for any young mind reading this: cultural iconoclasm is not far gone; never let your dreams or ambitions be stymied by anything or anyone. 
 Make it just *Indians in the title? The real Captain Vyom... [deleted] Too bad, india can’t retain any talent Rest In Peace, truly a role model in my books.  Ordinary girl from Karnal whose lofty dreams **- decision to emigrate, marry an american, get american citizenship -**  and indomitable courage took her to space. She's not Indian except for her race. She's an American who was supported by American education and taxes. Neither did she pay taxes in India nor did the Indian government spend tax on her to train her for space missions. Why exactly must Indians feel proud of an astronaut with absolutely zero connection to the Indian space programme? She wore an American flag in that official photo.

I feel like it's these kind of sentiments that reinforce the conspiracy theory that enemies of the state are sabotaging Indian fresh water systems with IQ reducing lead and other chemical contaminants. Most indians cant think critically anymore. What retardism is this? Fast and furious XII: faster than the speed of sound RIP I hadn’t heard of her, what a fantastic woman  A true inspiration! Her story is so inspiring !  I used to want to be her! 💕 [removed] I know this is off topic, but I heard there was an 6.1 earthquake yesterday in India?  Proud to be a Karnalite She looks like Dora the explorer... Thank god, the sandwiches sure won't make themselves up there. Pharah Role model for countless indians to please raise their kids abroad. ew I’d bet 7M dollars most Indians don’t even know this ladies name  How did she get to the USA and be able to fly on our shuttle? Are we just giving rides to anyone now? Want to be a role model for Indians? Stay home. Build your own space program. Fly your own kind to space! 

Jumping on board our shuttle doesn’t make you a hero. 

Also our shuttle sucks. It costs the American tax payer hella money and often blows up or can’t take off if the witn is above 5 MPH She went to USA though, which to me is a deal breaker. I know I'll get a lot of flak for this. No doubt she inspired us and generations to come, but she also inspired us to believe that if we had to go to space, usa is a viable choice. I think i is bad for the country in the long run. Stop with this feminism bullshit [removed] Better role model for Barron Trump than his own father; or mother, sisters, or brothers.

"Someone made a stormtrooper Ganesha.  Darth Sanskaar will get annoyed. I'd buy a t-shirt with this printed on it. This reminded me of my art class from 4th grade.We used to get a drawing  per class as classwork and once done,we could draw whatever we wanted in our drawing books.I was obsessed with cartoons back then so I'd usually end up drawing goku and bulma in compromising positions in my sketchbook.I'd draw a kamehameha explosion over whatever was inappropriate.It served as a personal censor.

Around diwali though,we were asked to make ramayana themed drawings.I made hanuman flying over the monkey sena with the mountain.Some fucker (probably during submission) drew dicks on some of the monkeys though  with a pen.

The teacher called me over to her desk and asked me sternly,"" *Yeh kya banaya hai tumne* ?""

I was caught in a fix but somehow managed to reply,"" *Raavan se ladte hue toh ache acho ke lode lag jaate hain madam yeh toh sirf bandar hai* "" The whole class erupted with cheers and the teacher made me the class monitor.For real though,I had to change schools. Finally all the obstacles of stormtroopers will be averted.  Good picture OP, but i don't understand the symbolism of skulls with ganesha.  This hurt my religious sentiments. Where did you find this? Damn I want a print of this स्टोरम्ट्रूपर क्या है? This will definitely hurt the religious sentiments of the various hindu snowflakes in power. [deleted] Amazingly Anti-national Jimmies getting rustled in 3...2....1 Not cool. The empire is old and sacred. You can't just tarnish it's image however you see fit.  Nicely done.  This is sooooo wrong!
Should have been a Boba Fett head instead. Ganesha was more like a badass samurai than a foot soldier Is this how Disney will take over India? I'm just wondering what have they used for the grey shade, doesn't look like charcoal or ink or pencil. I am still waiting for a Ganesh pandal where they make Lord Ganesha sit on iron throne. awesome This reminds me of this Hasan Minhaj act https://youtu.be/7HBYfkuhS0Y One of the most creative pieces of art I've seen on the internet  🙏 /r/empiredidnothingwrong Please post your facebook link as well. great art Gives warhammer vibe too! Looks really nice  I like your name ""boredmonk"" Would make a nice phonecover or a wallpaper  Source? Id like a wallpaper like image of this This would make a dope tattoo People still watch this Star Wars bull crap, given that the last 5 saga movies have been utterly shit ?! In one of the friends episode, Ross drops Bappa before having sex. :) :| :(  Definitely religious so I'm surprised it was tagged 'non political' /s I find your lack of faith disturbing. Please for the love of Ganesha. Dont show it in bombay. Next thing we know. Shiv sena is on the roads rioting.  Good Art Work Haha I always saw that little grey thing as a mouth I don’t remember Ganesha wearing a headdress, but there were eyes, so many eyes.  When you Are a Star Wars Fan & a Ganesha Devotee!! Looks good and the strokes are excellent! However it looks 80% stormtrooper and 20% ganesha.

That's my only criticism.  Just came here to appreciate OP for the post but some triggered people ruined the mood What does this stormtrooper miss? Heads. It's a nice piece of work, but doesn't resemble Ganesh tbh, probably cos of the air vents. Wow! That is beautiful!! You are very talented. Don't listen to the naysayers....keep doing you're doing!! :) But why? Am I missing some EU canon joke or something? Is that a penistrunk? As someone who hasn't watched Star Wars/Star Trek etc. but knows well about imperial German stormtroopers of World War 1, I was very confused for a few minutes.

That said, great work of art. Your karma is impressive you must be very proud RIP op. Must say well done! The lack of faith disturbs me Where's the mouse and laddoo? OP, could you link the artist's page in case someone is interested in buying his work? I don't know. Its artistic and I'm not religiously bothered. But it just doesn't click with me. Looks tacky or just wrong. Makichoot. Hope my angry religious fellow indians dont spot this. Im a hindu. But ya it’s not derogatory.  Mouth should be under the trunk?
 Nice attempt by rebels to get the Galactic Empire lynched by the fanatic mob! [removed] So I hear you like to play with fire?  Should I be offended by this? Looking at this in an artistic perspective, I enjoyed this drawing. It is a different, creative take on Ganapathi. And I’m a biggg fan of Star Wars. And I am sure (at least I hope) OP didn’t post this to offend anyone or poke fun of any belief.  However, a part of me is kind of offended. I pray to Ganapathi everyday. And I can’t help but feel offended, seeing a portrayal of him as a stormtrooper. Is there anyone out there that feels the same?  Good thing no one will die because someone drew this god If you don't like it, just let it go please don't criticise and hurt the Hindu sentiments.  You're in the queue. Nice illustration, but its also interesting to note we don't have to wait for westerners to misappropriate our culture with their superficial understanding; we are quite happy to misrepresent it ourselves these days, so superficial is our understanding of our ancient culture.  Thoda zyada ho gaya  Omg you are quite thick.

Just leave it.

The two issues being conflated all over the comments on this page are the depictions of god and people taking offense at them.

These are two separate issues.

"Don't call me to your wedding if your bridesmaids aren't dressed like this.  milk truk arrive Cow will be chopped in 4 pieces as soon as ladies separates.
 Wamen respecting cattle wamen. Yogi's Angels!!! The second lady from the right has the worst job in the world.  गौ हत्या ...करो? avant gau-matré Holy cow!!! *Ekdum गाय hai hamari chhoriya* What a moo-ving picture.  These ladies look truly bovine! The socks with the sandals is especially  impressive  4 girls one cow. Taking cringefest mainstream. OP, I need /r/eyebleach. The last lady has to walk around alone with a cow's ass on her dress, and the one beside her with an udder. All 4 better stick together for context 😂 They're so inseparable that only a Muslim can marry them. Kulcha boner ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) OP: puts politically sensitive pic.
OP: flairs Non Political. I’m cool with it. I’m especially loving the socks + flip flops combo. 

You think if I started selling toe socks in India, I would be a successful entrepreneur??? साली होती है एक चौथाई गायवाली Can someone translate? I don't speak Hindi looks like a poster was made into kurtas but we can eat them right. This was for a wedding? Nice to see where the country is heading in this 21st Century. if i see this when i go to a wedding, i am going back right away. if this is the best, nothing else is left inside anyway. If the ladies forget their order, it cold very well read, 'karo gau hatya'. 2, 3, 1, 4 Enthusiasm levels drop gradually going from right to left, starting with a YAY and ending with a fuck this. I'll take the third from the left.  Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free? *Kulcha intensifies. *

Seriously though, I'm stoned and it gets weirder. Are all the four dresses connected? The cow looks too perfectly laid out. The lady in the right side seems capable of producing more milk than the gau mata. (pardon me ladies for the sexist joke.). My sister started an orphanage in India and got married over there some time ago. I must say that compared to our weddings here, theirs are a million times more fun and interesting than the ones we have in the US I LOVE EATING BEEF 😋 Haute Couture Definitely will get drunk and hit on each one of them. ""Kutch Kadva Patidaar Samaaj""

That's Kutchi (Gujarati) girls for you, and that's the district I also hail from. r/facepalm Okay I just noticed after freaking eleven hours that the title is 'Don't call me to your wedding if your bridesmaids aren't dressed like this.' instead of 'Don't call me to your wedding if your bridesmaids **are** dressed like this.' Notice how the second woman's leg(from the left) and the cow's leg on the kurta are indistinguishable. Backside : ""kuch din toh guzaro cringrashtre mein."" A wedding with Yogi as the priest :')  Gotta be cow wedding. women are cows. each one is only 1/4rth of a cow. this is according to that picture.
 If they would dressed as goat it would be better Milk truck arrive. Is the ass end of the cow the most liked or least liked friend? milk I'd like the second one from left.

"Indian men line-up for a free meal on the occasion of Id-Ul-Fitr near Jama Mazjid, New Delhi. Most of these men are rickshaw-pullers, daily-wage laborers and homeless men who rarely get two square meals a day  Look at the guy, who is second from the right.

You can take an idea of his situation from his eyes staring at food.
 The story of my maid. Her son left her when she was 50. Then her daughter died who was married to a drunk guy. She left two daughters and now she is taking care of them. We offer her daily food and a good wage. Then she wraps some food for her daughters. There are so many people in poverty in our country it breaks my heart. My family is doing everything for her. All these people remind me of her. Desperate times desperate measures.   Just FYI, this happens everyday. All restaurants around the Jamma Majid on closing share all remaining food to anyone asking. They don't believe in refrigerating and reserving the next day. During closing hours of the restaurant you will find a lot of people squatting outside quietly waiting. 

This is the norm as far as I know. It’s hard for me to imagine that look the guy has and what he must be going through. Been blessed, never had to worry about food. It’s heartbreaking. I volunteer for an organization called Robin hood army that provides left over food from restaurants to the people in need. If anyone wants to help, you can visit the website and apply to be a volunteer in your city's RHA chapter.  For all those redditors who are getting married soon or going to get married in future, my two cents instead of throwing money on feeding 1000 people who can feed themselves plz limit to your close kin and try to feed the poor. I have seen marriages in my circles in recent past ranging about 35-40 lakhs and my heart just breaks when ppl spend so much on well off ppl who can afford everything themselves.  
 One of the greatest candid pictures I have seen ... Period !! My dream is to see an India where every stomach is full, one day I'll make it happen  That may be one of the most spine chilling images I've seen in a while. ~~Source?~~ Who gets credit for the image? India is worst on hunger index but we are busy in hailing king and politicians  I wonder what is the cost of cooking and serving 1 square meal (2 rotis, Rice, Dal, Subzi) if produced for 200 people. 


I want to provide 1 square meal to a bunch of poor folks. I will charge them only the cost of making that meal. Hopefully that would be affordable Came here from front page and it just breaks my heart seeing this picture of the second man from the right.  India has vast illiterate and malnourished (low Intelligent) population in 100's of millions.

Overpopulation, Malnutrition, illiteracy, hunger, poverty Good reminder that holiday celebrations are also about those around us who can't celebrate.   Widespread hunger issues are an absolute blot on the legacy of any nation.



Govt should set up a chain of organizations to help downtrodden people have easy access to cheap meals
and work day n night to ensure  no one gobbles up the funds alloted for it. 



That is the biggest fucking misfortune of this country,money never reaches the people its intended for. Meanwhile in MURIKKKA  is a crime giving out free food ! It'll be hard to waste food after seeing this picture.

Not that I normally waste food. But still, my heart goes out to those who go to sleep with an empty stomach. This Happens every day not only on eid. Also most of those men are beggars.  r/accidentalrenaissance Unpopular Opinion, will get down voted for sure.

In a city like Delhi labour is very scarce and hard to find. If someone is healthy and his entire family is working odd jobs, I don't think he will be hungry.

I think the people are eating there because it's free. [deleted] Overpopulation is a serious problem.  Someone in the other post was wondering why high class Delhi is  concerned about metro fare. I despise such poverty porn. Would the photographer dare to take such close up shots at an affluent dinner ball without permission?
I understand these people are poor, however they are still rich enough to have dignity and privacy (even though they might not know it). Taking such pictures without their permission strips them of even that basic right while resulting in what can be termed as ""Poverty Porn"". Please refrain from doing such. I would Slaughter the cows to feed the poor anyday Everyone loves free food. A lot of people organises ""Bhandara"" and I have seen Honda city pulling up next to the stall and eat.  [deleted] Well-off Muslims buy and slaughter whole goats and buffaloes (and until recently cows) on Eid al Azha (Bakriid). While technically they are supposed to distribute atleast 1/4 of the meat to the poor, very often people pick out the worst portions and organs for giving to the poor. Very sad.  Rickshaw pullers and daily wage laborers who do not get two meals a day. So how do they do the labor?

Don't write anything just to get sympathy. **It's such a noble cause and committee (*who organised such feeding feast*) might have taken pride feeding up such poor people who can't even earn to have proper meals three times a day, like we usually do** >> rarely get two square meals a day 
If this is the plight of folks in the Nation's capital, one can only imagine the plight of others The look on their faces.. how can we help them? This is why we badly need universal basic income .  Our poor, and working class bothers and sisters struggle not just in our backyards, but across oceans, across borders and across cultures.  We stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters who suffer and fight injustice, oppression, exploitation, abuse and starvation in New Delhi and around the world. ✊🏻🍞🌹 Perhaps humanity has no religion, caste or boundaries.

More and more people will hopefully start realizing this soon. very sad, these people are working in daily wages & very poor, so they can't afford Good food. True fact : I , like most people, wouldn't have been religious if it wasn't for the free food. 

Have eaten at  bhandaras in temples, langars in gurdwaras, christmas parties at churches and post eid iftars.  Secularism for the win !  What's a square meal? Never heard that term before. r/accidentalrenaissance  A long time ago there were discussions regarding restructuring our Public Distribution System, but that would also require major changes in agriculture. There hasn't been enough political will to make changes.  Yeah I go to eat at jama masjid for eid. People be lined up sitting on the ground like villagers in a movie with that 'sarkar sarkar' vibe. They all have to wait till the business time is over so it becomes 11-12 or 1 am before they get to eat. Its surreal .. I feel bad and for 1 minute and then I walk past looking for buttery kebabs And I thought that living in Mexico could be hard... Btw I have seen them many times give away meals , or this is a ridiculous coincidence whenever I have visited the area near Jama Masjid  super ach Thanks for my new wallpaper That meal is square.  Crores and crores of money wasted on useless election campaigns. For example in the recent gujarat campaign.... Moreover in most of the campaigns needless notes spent on useless rally, inappropriate amounts of pamphlets, huge posters etc. Yes, I understand that enlightenment of general public is also important but, isn't the amount spent hellish unnecessary.
 There are SO many ways we can uplift these souls Our civilization has failed Why not go to a langar? Where are all the women ?  I personally never give alms to a beggar since I regard it as shouldering the responsibility of the Govt. Why should I shoulder the responsibility of the Government ? Right to basics (food, water, shelter) has been upheld as an enforceable fundamental right by the Supreme Court.

 Culture is everything. Indians need to change their culture to be successful.  This is what happens when you have 7 children and you can’t afford to raise then  That’s truly heart wrenching......  If only the government had done something for poor....  No, my giving alms does nothing to solve the problem, that's why. I am not against giving money, I am against the fact that the person whose supposed to be doing something i.e. Government isn't doing it.

Suppose you are working in a company where a member of another team shirks his duty and as a result you know the Company will suffer. Will you pick up his slack without even informing him about his dereliciton of duty ? How long can you do that and why even ? Let the company sufer, eventually the Boss will be forced to act.

Similarly when the poor frustrated masses finally lose it and go all Arab Spring type and bring the knife to the Babus' and Big Shots' throats, something worthwhile might happen. At least they have nuclear weapons, a space program and an F1 team.     Now if they could just get plumbing and clean drinking water.    What you actually want to say about this Image & Text? That naan and curry looks so yummy. I'd wait in line too for that. 

My car mechanic who is Muslim brings me heavenly dishes during Id and all. I lick everything without shame. Quit reading the Kama-Sutra and having kids people. There, problem solved. I would bet that some of these homeless and poverty stricken men have children. How and why? Just amazes me why people get all sad.  SMH..... this is in worst part of indian most of india is not like this 

please dont judge india by this picture

this is also news stunt Is he serving shit to them? Thank you for posting this. Pictures like these help remind me how insignificant my problems. I was there during Eid. I think only few restaurants do this. Not all.  This is why I hate entitled USA Millennials with their sorry complaints about how bad life is.  They don't know what bad is.  These people, unfortunately, do. This is male suffering so most do not care. https://www.reddit.com/user/hsalman99/comments/7lv8zq/air_official_unreleased_game_trailer/ Show this to the people who think Muslim = Terrorism.  I don't understand why the Indian government (all of them till date) is indifferent toward the helplessness of these people. 
What's the need to dump crores in high speed metro projects when there are people to feed! Why not come up with a 'project' to provide food to the needy people? 
Why?  When a country has rampant over population and does nothing about it.... expect this.... Indians cannot run a country! Simple Atleast these guys dont ask for adhaar linkage for giving food to poor Why specifically mention Indian rather than just Men or people?

In the 21st century it is possible to eliminate nukes even when surrounded by countries that are nuts.  If anyone uses a nuke it’s pretty clear other countries will react to it, putting an end to it. 

Any jillionare in India who make enough to field an F1 team ( even with a second rate chassis and motor) got there only through corruption and exploitation of poor people, much like China.

It's like those roads in Japan and Hong Kong with a bunch of neon signs...but without the style lol. The average Indian street is such an eyesore.

"ToI delivers for a change  And that's how you creatively respond to unfair criticism. Not by barking all over the internet. Kudos TOI! [another one.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C416hR_VUAEC7HG.jpg) NYT has long history of being very unfair and critical of India. From opposition to civil nuclear deal, opposition to NSG membership, implying that India is obstructing paris Climate Change pact, running seemingly elitist cartoon on India's Mars mission. I do read NYT though daily.

only way for India is to be Technological and Innovation, Economic center of the world. India should achieve Double-digit Economic growth and improve quality of Life of every Indian, not for sake of the world but for ourselves. We could be 20-30 times better what we are today economically. Let's mobilize every Indian and join force for Wealth creation. Feels good man Upcoming Oped of NYT:

After the Indian space agency ISRO launched the so called 100 satellites, on the back of the subsidies provided by the Government, the Indian cartoonists went on an overdrive mocking a cartoon published in this newspaper some time back. We agree that launching satellites is still considered an achievement despite it becoming a commonly available technology and for that we congratulate ISRO, a government funded organisation mostly employing upper caste Brahmins form Southern India. The 88 of the hundred satellites were intended for a single project and will be counted as a single satellite in the developed world bringing down the number of satellites launched to less than twenty, it's though a small detail which shall be overlooked in the interest of the billion impoverished souls who rarely get something to celebrate.

In the spirit of cartoons and humor we welcome the criticism but this success is also a warning to the mankind in its endeavor to conquer the outer space. Space has been hitherto reserved to an elite club of western countries and Russia, all of whom have been cautious enough to keep it orderly and clean. However with the frequent invasions of the Space by the emerging Asian powers of China and India, the debris is becoming a huge risk to our planet. There is no central organisation like NATO which controls the space at the moment. However time has come for the western countries to work towards a common goal of keeping the skies clean and not let it reduce into an open defecation designated zone. 

India's ability to launch objects into the space at low cost, while praiseworthy also increases the risk of accidents and collision in the space which might result into debris falling over New York city or even London. We must act now and regulate the satellite launches taking examples out of the successful NPT and NATO treaties.    [deleted] This is good. we should do more achievements Notice how they took off the hand rails? Probably used in the satellite production. Because we Indians are jugaadus and don't need no million dollar material for our satellites. Subtle.  The failing NYT is FAKE NEWS. Very dishonest. So sad. It's a great cartoon, only problem is the things they're holding are rockets, not satellites.  Right in the balls of those neo-Nazi fucktards! All my hate for TOI aside, this is actually pretty classy. Maybe I'm wrong but I didn't feel nyt had taken a dig at India. 

The cartoon can just be interpreted in many ways. 

 # [YUSS!](https://cdn.meme.am/cache/instances/folder592/500x/67495592.jpg)

 Hey everyone, a lot of news channels are showing that we launched thrice the no. of Russian mission which is ~37. But they don't show that 37 of the satellites were of normal payload which is around 100 kg, whereas what we launched were nano satellites i.e. payload of about 10 kg. But this still doesn't lower the achievement in any way. This is gold I don't understand why we lack a sense of humor . The NYT joke hits us since its true at a certain level  , A farmer representing India with a cow need not be derogatory, also it mocks at the elitism of west and upholds the frugality of Indian space program. 

that said, scientific temper and a sense of humor is necessary .No point in overdoing our achievements. [removed] At last, something sensible from TOI. 

It's a relief after all those celebrity stories.  This is gold. :D Your turn NYT  Wait, why is Switzerland in this cartoon? It's the cow's expression that makes it for me.  At last TOI has delivered something good. India's like, ""we're bringing the cows with us"". a fairer response would have been big fat cowboys or big fat bikers knocking on the door not two guys in suits TOI for all your garbage pop up ads I cursed this is just amazing you deserve a round of applause 👏. I'm not offended by the original comic in the slightest. But the artist did try to poke fun at India's achievement back then. But it's all in good fun. It's a joke. There is some truth to it and all the comic did was exaggerate. Hyperbole is a common trait of jokes. That's literally how a lot of the jokes work. Nothing wrong with it.

That being said, the response was pretty funny and super witty. Very appropriate. The NYT artist was absolutely BTFO'd.  On the other hand; it's nice yes; but it's not *that* big of an achievement...  Came here expecting Baal ki Khal. Wasn't disappointed. I like it. Nice comeback and great technological achievement!

But why the Swiss flag? We make parts for satellites but not launchers. What did NYT mean by **ELITE SPACE CLUB** exactly? Did they refer to those countries who have sent men to space? Because there are only 3 such countries (now only 2 with the retirement of the US Space Shuttle) and this matches with the only 2 visible occupants of the club. kek He is very good in my opinion.  Did anybody notice the moustache of the Indian in the NYT and TOI cartoons ? I'm liking the detail. Ggwp I like how the turban has been subtly altered to look more like a bitchin' dye job. I really hope India keeps taking advantage of the fact that my nation has abandoned science.  I wish y'all nothing but the best of luck. Nailed it, couldn't get any better!!! Love this! Time to explore this universe! Isn't ANYBODY going to comment about the bull in India's Living room?  poo in loo In 2010 India only had 2 city's in the entire country with 24/7 clean drinking water.  Absolutely brilliant !! Don't think US will need India's help launching missiles anytime soon. The attire can be interpreted in various ways I don't think there is anything offensive about it and moreover it's TOI...no wonder they assumed it in the wrong sence.

Even if their intention was to mock I don't find any reason not to do it. Well you should have saved this when ISRO actually puts a rover on mars or venus.  Convenient to use the farmer, then trash him.  & 100 of those Satellites just weighed 10 Kg, just like the orbiter of MOM mission ! Matlab ek chiz ke peeche pad jao.

"Harsh reality is we're it  This feeling is far more deep seated than we realize. My mother used to tell me to respect everyone older than me in age, to touch their feet and to listen to them. To always do what they tell because our elders are wise. Bull effin shit. 

We are relentlessly taught not judge people and to always obey them based on their age and their clothes. A man in saffron is always respected without question. We need to teach our newer generations to respect people but not unquestioningly. To not trust strangers because of their clothes.  These days you need to leave your clothes outside as well. As an American, what is a Baba? The view angle makes it seem like someone left their eyeballs along with their brains LOL. And you'd be shocked how many of them are educated and rich.
People with a lot to lose usually seek haven in the arms of spiritual gurus . Why only this dhongi baba be arrested? Parents who sent their daughter for getting raped should also be put behind bars for child trafficking. Only if they had brain. I doubt brains go that far. They would keep it at home in shrink wrap probably. Does anyone know which community the victim was from. I wonder if gaajars and jhantus care if they knew the victim belonged to their community.  Blind belief in religion and religious heads is a human flaw. Not uniquely Indian.

The biggest flaw with Indians is the complacency in civic sense and grass root level of corruption. Reminds me of [this](https://youtu.be/sid40vLeMks) part from Christopher hitchens' book, god is not great.  If you can somehow give an individual's life some semblance of meaning, and that individual happens to be desperately searching for hope, you will most probably become rich overnight as those types of people will throw away everything they have for that hope and happiness. This is true everywhere, not only in India. Very sad Remove the slippers and you get ""This is how Indians watch Bollywood films"" I guess the dera bhakts drank the Panchkoolaid. Why only this dhongi baba be arrested? Parents who sent their daughter for getting raped should also be put behind bars for child trafficking. >I don't condone senseless violence especially when directed at innocents and I also don't condone a leader whose primary goals are to build wealth, power and feed his own ego. However, I will say that we shouldn't just write-off all his followers. Instead we should look into why he has amassed so many followers and why they feel so attached to him.

>I'm not sure how many of us Sikhs in the West are aware but a huge amount of Dera Sacha Saudas (DSS from now on) followers are low/out caste, down-trodden and mired by poverty. DSS specifically targets these oppressed people and provides them with uplifting hope. This can be seen in Gurmeet Ram Rahim's movies, one of which shows him taking a prostitute who is rejected by society, accepting her as a daughter and helping her get married. He welcomes the transgenders, the homosexuals (who he helps to ""fix"") and former criminals. He gives them hope; ""you can be loved too and be a valued part of society."" His lower-castes and downtrodden followers feel a sense of belonging and feel valued and equal to others. This gives them the precious gift of self-respect and confidence. And who do they have to thank for this new found strength? DSS. So, these followers become fanatically loyal to their uplifter. An attack on him is an attack on them.

>It is well known that what DSS (or any other Radha Soami Beas group, for that matter) teaches and does is to be found in Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Instead of being upset about Gurmeet Ram Rahim imitating the Guru and basically recycling the Guru's philosophy to his own ends we should ask ourselves why have Sikhs failed to reach these people? I will only answer the question with more questions. Why are there separate Gurdwaras for the Shudra and Dalit castes? Why are they looked down upon, rejected and thought of as unfit to share the leadership of the Dharam? Why do Jatts from Sikh families specifically target Dalit girls for sexual assault and rape? I think the answer is obvious to us all.

>Clearly, Sikhs have failed to include the lower caste in their universal brotherhood. Sikhi has become the religion of Jatts, Khatris and mercantile castes. The spread of the religion has stagnated to just these castes specifically their Jatis (sub-castes) of Punjabi origins. These castes have come to believe that Sikhi belongs to them and is only for them. The lower castes are set aside as unworthy. So, instead of being angry at opportunists who step in to fill the vacuum we should look at why we are so compliant in letting the vacuum exist. yo where de dead ppl at !! (too morbid? ok .. ) 
But, in all seriousness, while india is increasingly connected digitally, the education and skills gap is widening too. We need more jobs for our youth. We need to to pay more attention to the infrastructure in our hinterland. If the only time we look in the interiors and our small towns is when it goes up in flames; and that too, through the lens of an increasingly metro based/obsessed alarmist mainstream media, what do you think that makes us ? hint : it starts with ass .. ""united we stand"" isnt just a blurb, people.. time to walk the talk. I am pretty sure, it is not just for Babas, this phenomenon happens when most visits a mosque, voting booths, etc the reason, such people flourish is because upper caste doesn't include others in main rituals and decision making committee. Its not unconnected with caste based oppression. You practice disrimination on a daily basis, profit from it, survive on it, derive your pleasure from it. But when it turns around an bites you, suddenly everyone is illiterate/stupid/idiot? Man this is why foreign companies wanna hire us

We are taught to always respect people above us or older than us without questioning them

We are taught that working hard is the only way to make money and live successfully 

They just hire us and give us crappy salaries and expect us to be grateful for the opportunity to work for them as their slaves

And we are grateful because that's what we're taught from a young age We should prioritize education more than religion Just take wallets inside  And a Trump rally  Damn True, That is the only reason we are still a developing country.

When someone get raped...we burn candles when rapist get arrested, we burn cities. I believe I have fortified myself against such babas by repeating a single line almost once everyday: Man cannot become god.

If you believe this sincerely, you will be immune to the influences of such people. Wut's a baba?  Hahaha

(As long as you're talking about the other Babas. *My* Baba is obviously Brahman incarnate because he told me so).

Jeez, here you go: /s Could anyone explain the background to this?  What is a baba? Genuinely curious. Thanks Cartoon should also have other pieces of clothing as well. I reckon autocorrect is the culprit. He must have used some non-dictionary swear word, I think Then one day they also have to put clothes out.. greed makes cheaters thrive Apna h bas ek hi naara... Baba Ram Rahim h hmaara 😂 I think some people follow them because if ""just in case"" it's all real they can be in clear. Others follow like sheeps and many of them become blind followers believing Babas will save them.
I say 'Work is worship.' Nothing else. Also how many seem to use social media 😂 No we're not. This is just a regional thing. You won't find many places in India where people go out ready for violence unless they're assured of inaction by law enforcement agency and they gain some benefit out of it. This is bollocks level stupidity coming out of illiteracy. What is a baba?
 More like how idots visit babas. No, the same is true for all religious institutions and houses of warship.  Whenever I see these babas and their bhakts, I am reminded of [this scene from the True Detectives](https://youtu.be/_RfUj09pWfM)

""The Secular State""
September 5, 1973 

Prabhupada: All over the world, they are expecting something spiritual enlightenment from India. That is a fact. But our government is callous in that respect. Therefore any so-called swami, yogis, come from India, they gather to receive him, to hear something from him. Yes. This is the tendency, that... The real thing is that people expected something... Still they are respectful to India on account of the spiritual enlightenment. That I have studied. Still they go to India to have some spiritual enlightenment. And actually we have got this in India. If anything has to be learned about spiritual, then it is only India. That has been admitted by one Chinese gentleman. He's a learned scholar. His book is recommended in New York University. I forget his name. He has written in his book that ""If you want to learn something religion and spiritual, then you must go to India.""
Ambassador: It must be Lin-yu-tang, no.

Prabhupada: Eh?

Ambassador: Was it Lin-yu-tang?

Prabhupada: I don't know.

Ambassador: Yu-tang. You see he's a very great admirer of (indistinct)

Prabhupada: And that's a fact. But our Indian government is not very serious about it.

Ambassador: No, we have a difficulty, Your Eminence. We have got a problem in India because we have got this multi-religious society. So we have to be careful. But individuals can...

Prabhupada: No...

Ambassador: Because we have got to be... We should not be misunderstood. As a government, we should not take too strong a policy about any particular religion, even though it is the religion of the majority of the people.

Prabhupada: No, no, no. It is the duty of the government... Secular state means neutral to any kind of religion. But it is the duty of government to see that people are religious. Not that ""Because government is secular, let the people go to hell.""

Ambassador: No, that's true.

Prabhupada: Yes. If you are Muslim, and, it is my duty as government to see that you are actually acting as a Muslim. If you are a Hindu, it is the government's duty to see that you are acting as a Hindu. If you are a Christian, it is the government's duty. You cannot give up religion. Dharmena hinah pasubhih samanah. If people become irreligious in the name of secularism, then they are simply animals. So it is the government's duty to see that the citizens are not becoming animals. He may profess a type of religion. That doesn't matter. But he must be religious. That is secular state. Not that secular state means government is callous, ""Let the people become cats and dogs, without religion. Government doesn't care."" That is not good government. What do you think?

Ambassador: I think, Your Eminence, there's a lot in what you say, but, you know, politics is the art of the possible.

Prabhupada: No. No, politics means to see that people are advanced, citizens are advanced, not that they are degraded.

Ambassador: Your Eminence, I agree, but I think the duty of the government primarily is to provide conditions in which gifted people, spiritual people like you, leaders like you, can function. More than that, if the government does, it might probably even corrupt the religious... I don't know. Like an umpire in a game, you know, or something... Provide the conditions, provide the conditions for free speech. Not like Moscow, you know, where it is...

Prabhupada: No. That is... Just like you have got the Commerce Department. Government has got. What is the duty of the Commerce Department? The government must see that the trade enterprise, common share, or industrial enterprise, they are doing nicely, properly. The government issuing license. They have got supervision. They send sometimes, what is called, inspectors? Education. Say, for education. There is educational inspector, school inspector. They go see that the students are properly being educated in that school. Similarly, government should have expert men in the government to see that the Hindus are acting like Hindu, Muslims are acting like Muslim, and Christians are acting like Christian. The government should not be callous about religion. They may be neutral that whatever religion you profess, government has nothing to do. You do nicely. But it is the government's duty to see that you are doing nicely, you are not bluffing. That is government's duty.

Ambassador: Probably, as far as moral conduct is concerned, but more than that, how is it possible, you know? For the inner man in the spiritual mind, each individual can conceive his own philosophy, but the external conduct, the, the, what is called...?

Prabhupada: No, no. External conduct means on religious principle.

Ambassador: This is what I was...

Prabhupada: Yes. Harav abhaktasya kuto... I... You can, you can...

Ambassador: Yes.

Prabhupada: ...understand Sanskrit.

Ambassador: Yes.

Prabhupada: Harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-gunah. Yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akincana sarvair gunais tatra samasate surah [SB 5.18.12]. If one has got faith and devotion to God, God is one... God is neither Christian nor Hindu nor Muslim. God is one. So religion means according to... Not according to... This is the Vedic conclusion.

If you want to keep... In Calcutta, there was, in the American Consulate Office, I was invited. There, they have got a department: ""Indo-American Cultural Society."" Perhaps you know.

Ambassador: I heard about it.

Prabhupada: I was invited there to speak: ""East and West."" So I explained that so far we are concerned, we have no such thing as east and west. But still, there is difference between east and west that in the Eastern countries, especially in India, even in the remotest part of the village, a cultivator, poor cultivator, he'll understand God consciousness very easily. And so far in the West, I talked with Professor Kotofsky... Perhaps you know.

Ambassador: Yes. In Oriental Institute.

Prabhupada: Yes. He said, ""Swamiji, after this body's finished, everything is finished."" You see? Such a big professor. He...

Ambassador: That is Marxist materialism.

Prabhupada: Eh?

Ambassador: It is Marxist materialism.

Prabhupada: But Marxist materialism, does it mean a congregation of some fools and rascals?

Ambassador: I think so, true.

Prabhupada: Does it mean they like that some congregation of fools and rascals? Such a big professor, he does not know, he cannot understand even that there is life after death. He has to accept another body. As we are accepting different bodies. I was a child. You were a child. Then I became a boy. That is different body. Different consciousness also. A child, three-four years, he talks in a different way. A boy, ten-twelve years, he talks in a different way, and a young man, educated young man, he talks in a different way. So with the change of the body, the consciousness is changing. Is it not?

Ambassador: Yes.

Prabhupada: Children, small children, they're just like animals. The cats and dogs, just they are playing, they're also playing like that. But he, he does not belong to that category because when he'll get..., he'll get another body in which he'll be intelligent. Another body, he'll be highly educated. Another body, he'll be doctorate. The cats and dogs, they'll have to wait to get that body. So with the body, we are changing our consciousness. So different body, different consciousness. Similarly, why not after death a different body, different consciousness? If you make progress. Yes. This is progressive. So that is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita: tatha dehantara-praptir dhiras tatra na muhyati [Bg. 2.13].

dehino 'smin yatha dehe

kaumaram yauvanam jara

tatha dehantara-praptir

dhiras tatra na muhyati

 [Bg. 2.13]

So people cannot understand. That means they are not dhira, not even, according to Vedic conc..., not even gentlemen. One who cannot understand this simple theory, that, ""After this body, as I have changed so many bodies, similarly, I shall change this body also."" That's a fact. So dhiras tatra na muhyati. Dhira, one who has got brain, one who can think, he'll not be puzzled. ""Yes, he has... Death means he has changed body."" Any gentle, good brain will understand. But people are so foolish now, they cannot understand. They are not educated even to understand this simple thing. This is the position of the world. Even a big professor like Kotofsky. So this is the position of our present human society.

"Mumbai man cleans 5 million kgs of trash in 96 weeks. [X-post r/pics].  My boss went to Japan and described how everyone just has a natural habit of holding onto trash until they get home, then disposing of it properly.  Completely unlike the Indian mindset... He said it was the most impressive thing about Japan to him I really hope #trashtag takes off in our country, unless we as a community take charge of sanitation and hygiene, nothing will change. We throw our trash, destroy public properties and  keep blaming politicians, municipality and everyone else. This mindset needs to change. Taking pride in our towns, cities and community is far better than taking pride in castes and religion.  Is this about Afroz Shah? If yes then let me tell you he is a wonderful person. He came to our college last year to invite us for those cleanups. He is a great guy, fighting for a great cause Swachh Bharat - The No Bullshit Way. 

Afroz Shah is an icon. In an age where most of us put off cleaning up our own backyard or the loft or that pile of old stuff in our drawers we've been meaning to sort for a while or whatever, this dude goes and cleans up a frigging beach.

Respect.  This #trashtag challenge may be the best social media challenge ever Turtles hatched on the beach after 20 years 

Link: https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/breeding-site-of-olive-ridley-turtles-in-mumbai-s-versova-beach-is-not-fake-egg-shells-spotted-1196174-2018-03-23 Movie Based On This Coming Soon. I was just on this beach a few months ago.  It's too bad that 5 million KG of trash doesn't even come close to what Mumbai puts out in a day.   India (for that matter, the world) needs to vastly alter its trash protocols.  The onus shouldn't only be on people (heroes) picking up litter, but the companies that produce disposable packaging in the first place.   India also needs a lot more public trash receptacles--most people just litter. The same thread has two other pieces of information-

1. The beach was cleaned with the help of around [500 volunteers, not alone](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/22/asia/mumbai-beach-dramatic-makeover/index.html
)

2. The beach was back to [being dirty again.](https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-versova-beach-is-dirty-again-here-s-why/story-fYBkgQXhnHTXnXdqRCQ01H.html) 



I am unaware of the current status though. It was Deku who cleaned it. It is such a mythical effort by a small number of people for a selfless act to clean it by taking productive time out of their life, but it is profoundly saddening at the same time to see how many miss to have moral fabric to keep their surrounding clean. It is not challenging to carry the thought of public space cleanliness and awareness towards nature, but it is an ego trap of many that this change is a question to the current mindset. I always wonder what would be the best generic way to promote the idea of public cleanliness without offending various egoistic psychologies.  Now it’s on public and the municipality to maintain. If they turn to the wrong side of the pic god help those souls. Great work posts like these make me think that there are selfless people and ppl who want to see the world as a better place and work towards it. It seems he razed the ugly buildings too! I feel like this is just a case of moving the trash...it will eventually end up somewhere else, our country doesn't have a proper system for trash collection or reduction.
 r/detrashed Whoa for real? Wow! Salute to that man How did he stop other idiots littering one region while he cleaned another region?  we don't need hashtags for something good but I guess it's a good start, also every parent should teach their children's not to throw litter on road or public places it's our responsibility to teach next generation about cleaning habits.  If I can't give him karma does it matter? He had the help of 500 other people. Wow. Is there a video which I can take a look at too ?  While Delhi Man on the other hand... This is amazing!!  Great Example for everyone!  That's midoriya training Woh toh theek hain, lekin ye kachra jaataa kaha hain? I have no clue how we'd clean the largest network of trash trail in India, i.e, trash littered around railway lines. The 1/2/3 AC seem to have some sort of dustbins, but most of the old sleeper/second class coaches don't have one. So most people throw it out of the window instead of keeping it with them and waiting until the next stop. This man deserves our nations Padmashree award. As well sadly the beach will be dirty again in few days, since the mess keeps coming from ocean tidal waves. /r/TrashTag. Deku IRL. I won't be surprised to see him become a famous superhero. How do I help ? I mean is there a site where you apply to be a volunteer ?  Midoriya..? Someone is training to handle one for all The world should stop producing plastic. It's not cleaning when we take our trash to somewhere else. Hold in there I am gonna do this challenge as soon as my board exams are done so let's keep this challange alive at least till 29 march 2019
We can do this!!! If people here spent as much time in keeping their surroundings neat as they spend on hair, things won't go this bad to begin with. You're cleaning our trash. Thank you. What happens to the trash that was collected?  Too bad people will mess it up again.  Looks like someone is training under All Might.  Half the Manchester fans are plastic and trash  Please spend a day Or two in our parliament too.  Hats-off to him ,taken his precious time to clean this mess Speechless. This is real community service. God bless him and hope he doesn’t have to repeat this service.  👏👏👏👏👏👏 Absolutely amazing. Good job.  I sometimes lose hope for our country but people like this man keep me going to make our country better. One For All was passed down to him after this  He's training to inherit One For All Getting flashbacks of My hero Academia. Jokes aside. This guy deserves something. Where exactly does the trash that was collected go, as far as I know there aren't any landfill nearby? We should enforce mandatory hours of daily public cleaning for every politician. 

&#x200B;

Then they'll be more interested in running their sanitation departments properly. great initiative by that person and other volunteers who helped him. I hope soon we don't need people like that. If you look at a current picture, its back to the trash pile.  Unfortunate,  but when the majority are messing it up, it's hard to keep up. This got more attention than swach bharat  These are the kind of people who give me hope for living in India  Really. The math works to 7.4 tons of trash moved each day. I call bullshit. .... 1 weekend later its again in the same condition. Plastic is now banned here in Tamil Nadu, except for a few businesses and industries. Everyone here are using recyclable stuff and actually take cloth bags when they go for shopping. Everyone from street vendors to super markets are now not using Plastics :) A complete ban will gradually take place here. Also I find less plastic trash than ever before now. Hope this inspires rest of India to ban plastic in their states as well.",Non-Political
"Indians Right Now.  Pandya was the only guy in the Indian team who didn't know the match was fixed. So Jadeja took matters into his hands and ran him out. /s Better team won. Let's not be soldiers and be sportsmen. Saar, why are we even playing cricket when soldiers are dying? /r/OutOfTheLoop? Uh, not really. It was only yesterday to get over the cricket loss. No one knows who scored, what tournament, nothing! People are back to discussing why Virat didn't bat first and how Jadeja should be punished! We have hockey world cup in bhubaneswar next year. People here actually love hockey. Stadium remains packed during HIL matches. So world cup will be pretty cool too unless they jack up the ticket prices .   They were winning so many matches in the past. But no one really noticed nor encouraged their efforts.  The sad thing is, we wouldn't have given a crap about hockey if we won the cricket match. Is that Irrfan Khan? I liked the heavy influx of ""It's just a game bro"" comments in my whatsapp groups. Copied straight off of AIB's facebook... [removed] You can win with ball and stick... let me show you this one neat trick The 'Jadeja' word definitely rings a bell.  🤣🤣 Take it easy and listen to this man
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZSeHKmiUg what is a kirket?? [deleted] Okay, so everyone knows that the better team won, it's a sport and all that bs. The real question is how were our players performing so obviously poorly. Right from the beginning of Pakistani batting, the field was set wrong and never adjusted to the shots. Then all the top order batsmen hitting silly shots. Virat giving away his wicket just after a misfield saved him.

See we all know that it's just a game, and one with lot of uncertainties. But you have to answer the difficult questions after a loss because you have been given a position of importance and responsibilities. By bringing a victory in a sport they don't give a fuck about for like 364 days a year, Indians clearly show that they are just sore losers. Get over it.

"Jatayupara, Jatayu Earth Center, Kollam, Kerala [x-post r/pics]  Incredible that I've unfortunately never heard of this wonder. Tourism needs to focus on more than just Taj Mahal. Omfg what is that. Need more info I've visited Kerala more times than I can count and I haven't seen this!!! I'm going back there rightaway. Thanks! I’ve been there last year. They have a outdoor activities and stuff like rock climbing, rope walk, archery, rifle, paintball etc. Even a nice little lunch too. Really beautiful place. When comparing to the world's biggest Sardar Patel statue, this far smaller statue looks magnitudes better in terms of design, texture and aesthetics.. Jatayu was a vulture in the text but I guess they don't look as pretty as eagles.

I mean, we've been lightening up dark skinned gods anyway. statue wahi banega Hidden gem Jesus, this is nice. And here i thought this existed only in WhatsApp forwards! Designed by Rajeev Anchal, filmmaker & sculptor. Some names are just cooler for some reason.  

*Jatayu* just has that oomph & power to it when its said out loud. 

*Bhisma* is also a bit like that. 

Some of these names often gives me goosebumps for some reason, maybe its childhood nostalgia on having grown up with these stories or maybe there is some frequency resonance thing going on with the way these names get pronounced at times. 
 
I wouldn't be surprised with that theory given that Indic Civilization and its legacies are more oral dominant than written hence the importance of sound in relative terms was much more significant than in other places. Wonderful, would love to go there some day. credit to @jonny.melon, aussie travelgrapher on Instagram. 

the guy spent 2 weeks in Kerala on a Kerala Tourism sponsored trip, and all of his pics from the stay are spellbinding. r/IncredibleIndia I thought Jatayu was a vulture? Some nice aerial footages of [Jatayu Earth Center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWUzqIwMMZI). Jatayu's hometown? more info please. When was it made, and by whom? Amazing art 😍 hats off to architects To be honest this is more aesthetically pleasing than the Statue of Unity despite the similar colors. Pretty sure it's wayyyyy cheaper too The [drone view](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tkZXLbKVaw) is equally awesome. Copying this from Dhruv Rathee post: 

 The Jatayu Statue in Kerala is all what Statue of Unity isn't -

- Looks amazingly beautiful 
- Built at a cost of only ₹100 crore as an eco-tourism project
- Funded completely by private investors 
- Will recover it's cost in only 5 years
- Jatayu Earth Centre includes Ziplining, Rappeling, Trekking, Wellness Centre, Adventure Park, Cable Car ride to the mountain and a Museum.
- Kerala Govt spent zero money building this r/farpeoplehate This is awesome man. I had no idea despite being a South Indian Will visit this over statue of unity multiple times. Even if there's no entry fee I'll pay for this majestic artwork. I understand that people are not allowed to climb it? Incredible! Wow. Freaking awesome man ! Looks nice than that statue of unity. Give credit to the photographer. This is a photo from @jonny.melon account. Ye Rss ne bnaya h kya? Did that .. did that eagle just pulled a quick one on us ? And how come I getting to know this now!? How did you get there? That's amazing Proof that Assassin's had their HQ in India too. Beautiful Majestic AF Wow What time this was built? I went to Kerala but never saw this... Next time, definitely going to visit this place! Does anyone else think the face looks similar to Pikachu face? This looks magnificent. What is an earth centre ? Nice That is officially the most badass statue I have ever seen. I saw this one in xda too😂 Wow this is so beautiful. Definitely on my go to list. Thanks! This is incredible! My wife loves birds and we're planning a trip to Kerala later this year. This is definitely on the list of places to go to. Don't lie to me that's the Skyforge. Statue of women safety and honor as per their website. Straight out of assassins creed odyssey!! They could’ve built a cancer research center with that much money /s It looks like the eagle stubbed its toe. Marvelous. [deleted] My nigga jatayu Great stuff. Looks like it was funded privately. Considering that we are comparing it to Sardar's statue, I wonder how we could've got private donors for SoU? Stop wasting money on fucking statues.

edit: Why the downnvotes? Have we stopped hating on statues? Did I miss the memo? Look at the natural background, this structure ruined the scenery. They could have build a Government multi specialty hospital instead of this",Photography
"Swapna Burman, 6 toes in both legs, no money for special shoes. Father a rickshaw puller, mother working in a tea garden, running for her country in the final event of the Heptathlon with a bandaged jaw. And winning it for India This country certainly has no shortage of heroines  Can't wait for Bollywood to make her biopic with Sonam Kapoor in the lead and fucking it up completely.  Source: Joy Bhattacharya on twitter. Fucking great. I was also born with twelve toes. This is where our similarities end.  Dayyyyum. Her arms are better than mine.  I am glad that non cricket sports are getting more and more female role models. One of india's biggest core problem is the gender gap in employment and this would encourage closing it.  I can't handle this. This is amazing... I saw a picture of a text book in West Bengal depicting Milkha Singh as Farhan Akhtar from Bhaag Milkha.
Times are changing in India. But they are too ducking slow. Time to honour the real heroes and patriots.
And stop helping Bollywood in creating utterly crap movies. For Ex: Sultan

Sultan doesn't show any training. Just that he falls in love and those athletes who are busting their ass since they were probably 5 yrs old are all defeated in 6 months? Dafuk?  Now I feel shitty for complaining about waking up and still being tired.. Truly inspiring.  Can we somehow donate to her or her family? What's her UPI id? [This dude too](https://youtu.be/XaEGDS_curQ?t=3m5s). I was laughing at his rather unconventional throwing stances but he ended up demolishing his competition and won gold for India. Dude is like the Hulk.  Perfect example for ""what's your excuse?"" Might be mistaken but I think her name is Swapna Barman not Burman. 

Apparently the tape was used to help with a toothache in and infected tooth that flared up at the start of the competition. It was decided to try antibiotics rather than removing the tooth mid competition.  Look at that face. Look at that body language.

Iron clad determination!  How I see it is that India does not deserve such heroines when it cannot feed them or at least provide them with the infrastructure. It is ironic to say the least and very sad that to achieve basic standard of living is a quest for the common man in India. A hero the country needs right now, but not the one it deserves I think that is not inspiring but opposite of it. Telling everyone how our country doesn't care about any sports person no matter how badly they need help or caring intervention.. Our country sux. We all should be ashamed of ourselves.. This and many such truths just points to sorry conditions and diminishes all hopes for youth aspiring to excel in sports. OP , Hero should be gender neutral.
She is my Hero. India can't afford spl shoes for her? Poor country? But can afford to send her to Jakarta ? How? Congrats Swapna Burman for her great achievement even in a time when she was in great pain  first thing I see on reddit today - immediate goose bumps. well done. Very well done. No offence, but i legit thought that bandage was some sort of  Flag. Am i the only person who read the last word as heroine? I know this isn't the point and I am happy for her achievement and what it means for our nation, but she is really hot. Those arms! * swoon * Now that's a role model girls should be looking up to. Not fucking Karina Kaif and shit. India has enough money to feed an army of incompetent bureaucrats and politician-cronies to plum sports offices with first class international travel etc., but ACTUAL sportspeople and their families will live in poverty. The Sports Ministry expects impoverished people to win medals on their own grit, claims credit for when they actually do, and then goes back to its sarkari routine of incompetence, apathy, and neglect of actual sport.  If only we could treat our sportsman/ woman as we treat our cows, we could we winning Olympic medals by boatloads but knowing our government and its cronies hey would rather apply to make COW Safety a Olympics game rather. Daughters of India are making us proud big time. Hope they get good recognition and awards for their sacrifice None of the other nations are that surprised that women from India can run really fast. Hail mother india !! ⛹️🤼🏊🚴🤾️ This is the story of the entire Indian economy.  The Indian Government fucking people in the ass till they can barely walk, and then the people persevering and triumphing somehow, and then the Minister arrives and places a garland on them and puts articles in the paper so the country looks good.  


If you want to know how full of behanchods the government is, just see how the sports bureaucrats travel and their baggage allowance, and then see how the athletes travel and their allowance.  


Or if you want to feel your gut wrench at the limits of disgust, examine how the sports budget is spent in terms of funds and facilities for athletes versus salaries, benefits, offices, and allowances for the bureaucrats.  


Every time an injured veteran is working some menial job to make ends meet or an athlete is begging around town for sponsors just to get fresh fruits and meat for their diet, Indians should protest.  Because, believe me, Indian Government has allocated enough funds to develop sportsmen and sportswomen in India ... but those funds are being used to employ and benefit behanchods in the bureaucracy instead. Sometimes I feel the country doesn't deserve her. Talents like her are nurtured and groomed in other countries. I know I shouldn't be complaining and working towards it. I normally do. Today is not that kind of day. Pardon me. Proud of her. Feminism aside... Why is her face held together by tape?  Big deal! Hritihk Roshan has 2 thumbs in one hand and still managed to do that dance step! She's an Inspiration for future athletes. My girl!❤️ you go gurl Amazing ! She is real heroine of India.she inspire all people of India for her work. Wish if I could give you a gold for title No shortage of heroin  
FIFY Watching her mom's reaction to seeing her win, I cried.

I hope Swapna gets some brand endorsements, her story is incredible.  We don't deserve her.  Fuck yeah, this woman probably works harder than any of us can begin to comprehend Where can I see her actual performance? I can’t believe the amount of spam videos with slideshows when i google her name!  India doesn't deserve such relentless sportspersons. Sad but true. This should be before she got to Indian team. Typical of Bollywood, let some unknown win some shit and then the Bollywood vultures circle around to make monies and ride to fame Correct me if I am wrong but I've noticed that all of Indian sportspersons are either from quite wealthy families or from very poor families like in this case. The salaried middle class never produces top class athletes. What can be the reason behind this? Jai hind  And I still wonder why Indian women are demanding equality when they are so much better than us Whats the difference in havigg six toes? Damn straight there’s no shortage heroine She was designated runner of India  This. Is what true feminism is. She sure must have the dignity of her country in her head but she is fighting for herself. For a better future and recognition. 
Edit: i forgot to add country. And i still stand by what i wrote.  Lots of heroin in India now [deleted] what a story.....WHAT a story (Y) I love heroin it does not take much to make heroines nowadays....bandage jaw hahahaha Nor heroine Hero* >6 toes in both legs

There are layouts being formed all over the place. Many of them are already ready.. 10-15 years later, it's going to be an urban sprawl there. [deleted] Yet to find an IT fresher, who doesn't go to Nandi Hills within first month of posting in Bangalore. ""Sarcasm intended"" Where did you camp in Nandi hills? I thought it is not allowed to camp there at night. I've seen a lot of 'view from nandi hill' pics. This is the best of them all BY FAR. Brilliant shot! I'd love to this myself. Am riding to Kolli hills in January from Hyd and wanted to stay over at Nandi hills for the night. Where can I camp ? I've never been there before. Thanks :) I live near by Bangalore but never got a chance to visit this place. I will plan out one day and visit it. 

what is the best time to go there? evening or morning? 

Thanks for sharing That's awesome.. Take my upvote Been there. It's an awesome place. Especially the ride to reach that place on bike. And the clouds seem so near that you feel like touching them.  I remember visiting this exact spot and the guide telling us not to go ahead due to a steep fall right at the edge. Anyone visiting please be careful, some people also died while getting a click. The army uses it for base jumping/rock climbing so you can get an idea how deep and abrupt the landscape is. This is just north of bengaluru and was our hangout spot! OP beautiful shot, can you please tell me which Camera and lens you used?  I love this! Do you have an instagram / Flickr account for your photography?  Proud. Thanks for my new wallpaper.  Which app did you use for the edits?  Set it as my wallpaper first, upvoted later. Such serene view. Beautiful.  EXcellent click and amazing view.

When I visited this place, I missed this view...It was too cloudy and foggy. Hi OP, is this the place one comes to after paying the entry tickets? Or is it an entirely different side altogether?

Are bikes allowed till this point? Nice Post, beautiful of nadi Hills in Karnataka. Nice shot! I am thinking of driving there from Hyderabad (about 500 to 600 km). Are there places or trails around to trek or hike or climb up a hill? Looking for a really good trek.  Hi, great pic. Reminds me when I was last at Nandi hills.

Is the photo is HDR or treated? The colours are amazing. super r/travel Hey man, such a brilliant picture. Would you mind sharing which camera you used and the technique?

You camped in Tent or rented some place?  That's weird. 
I have lived in Bangalore all my life and as have visited Nandi a couple of times and I know for a fact that no one is allowed to go up between 9 PM to 6 AM. 
When did you take this picture?  Hey! What did you mean by camping? Like the real camping? Can we once talk about it? 
I've always wanted to camp around India Nd wanted to know if it's possible Do they still allow you to camp even now with 2018 few weeks away? I mean they close the gate at the start of the hill right? 
How’d you manage to camp up there? Pls let us know! 😃 I saw same pic on Quora six month ago.🤔🤔 Incredible view! I'd like to see it some day. sweet jesus! Dat smog! Does not seem like nandi hills from any angle. Wow. NRI here, I can't wait to go back and see this part of India.

"Grocery shopping list of an Indian wife  >Mirchi - Ask for free

..... Okay, list is very cute but ye 350gm bhindi ka kya logic hai? Who buys like that?

Ek pav, do pav, 250gm, half kg, kg.. ye samajh aata hai. But 350gm kaun mangta hai bhaji wale se?

 Era's a keeper. If someone could create more of these visual references for selecting vegetable it'll be great. Most often than not I and my wife are just standing there choosing vegetables based on some random intuition. 

Actually nowadays I just ask the Sabziwala to deliver it to us. No additional benefit of selecting it ourselves.  It's like she's written a grocery list for a small child. This is how my mother would write lists for me when I was a child. Are you allowed to break them from behind to check? Or will the vegetable seller stick a mirchi up my behind? [deleted] Haha damn cute.

Mirchi for free!🌶️ Typical 2 people household Came from r/all.
Great wholesome post OP.

That's what she said. You have a good wife. Cherish your life with her.

For few of us with failed marriages, I miss these small snippets of life.  I wonder if Indian market tomatoes taste like wet cardboard too. Bring back ugly tomatoes.  I'm in love lol. Those diagrams  You hug that woman, OP. You hug her and never let go!! Why did I read this with an awful racist accent? graphic designer? Get me a wife who can do this Didn't mention to put tomatoes on top in the bag, tomatoes are getting all mashed up Ey, who buys 350gm bhindi? Ek pao, aadha kilo, etc. Lekin yeh science experiment kahan se aya? > Era ❤️ Yeh pitega saala. 

There is no room for error. This went viral from here. Can this be considered as Womansplaining ? This is not a complete list. She forgot the one most important thing that you have to get every time you go out for buying groceries. And that is DHANIYA. > Good leaves, no holes.

As a beginner kid, I used to simply give the list to the shopkeeper and wait around for an hour while he takes his time bringing the list together, all while serving other patrons. Once I started playing video games, I learned that reading out loud and improvising based on locations, I will be done quicker and go save the princess from the castle. Of course. Why else would a husband know what's good if the wife doesn't tell them.  Mmmm bet Era can cook like a champ. Nice/cute requirements specification!  Had Indian engineers do such documentation - they would have been at next level?

btw, I got some nice tips 
 Love the heart at the end. Nice touch So bae Man. I Wish my mom would write her shopping list like this. She barely writes, and even when she does, she forgets like 2 things, and I have to go back and get it..

[Good job Era. :)](http://justsomething.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/guns-replaced-thumbs-up-20.jpg) No seriously I've always needed a 101 course on how to pick vegetables Wow! Such thoroughness! I say 'large red onions', 'bell peppers - mixed colors' and 'a dozen brown eggs', my friends think I made an exhaustive list! This is infinitely better!!

Edit : a word. Stupid autocorrect! So cute !!!!!!!  Haha this made me laugh! Thanks.  This is awesome. 😂 She likes it ""long & straight"".  So the husband never purchased vegetables till that point of his life?0_o

I'e been buying vegetables since I was in 3rd standard. Even then I did not need such visual aids to know whatis good and bad This is actually very well illustrated. It would take a lot of effort.

Also love the pictorial representations for Potatoes, Mirchi & Palak. Or Indian son / Father / husband > Easily breakable from behind.

 good information how to purchase vegetable, potato with no eyes,methi height less .... As a dude that is continually vexed by the cryptic nature of my wife's shopping lists...I would wholeheartedly embrace this level of detail. TOO GOOD.. why doesn't the servant or the driver do the shopping - this is an Indian household so they must have servants. 

This image has been viral on my whatsapp group since Friday. This is adorable Curry pata pick up after paying bill The most epic thing on Randia! :D The drawing for medium-sized potato should be real helpful. No diagram for bhindi?  

I'm gonna fuck this up.  I like my women like my mirchi.  My shopping would have been so much more fun if I got a list like this!  hd Cute stuff! Also, you got a nice handwriting!

 In these times of hybrid vegetables and pesticides, the instruction needs modification. I buy tomatoes with some holes, as it may have less pesticide which helped insects to reach it. Hybrid Tomatoes also have hard skin, those with softer skin break. Buy some with broken skin, . Only problem is you have to consume immediately, they won't last.

"How to get more volunteers for 'The ugly Indians' cleanup campaign? Below was result of 3 hour and 15 volunteers  If you are keen to participate then follow their Facebook page titled: 'The ugly Indian'. Check for events section on Friday. They have events every weekend. Mostly in Bangalore Ffs the people in this thread talking like they don't wanna do anything and yet expecting improvement from others. 

When the society as a whole participates, the local municipality isn't gonna oppose them. 

Also, OP, if you want more people to participate, advertisement is the key. There are people who are willing and there are people who are not. We can't change that. The only thing we can do is bring in more of the former. A simple pamphlet in the local newspaper would do it.  Question: What do you do with all the garbage collected? I'd be up for spotfixes in Thane / Navi Mumbai. How do I find out if any are planned? Can we have /r/india meetups but for this? Rather than chilling in cafes and malls, why not get to the streets and clean up? I'm in. Is this in Mumbai? Great job.

I don't know about your state. But in my state, dustbins are not adequate.

Last night, while I was returning from jogging, I bought a juice (tetra pack). After having it I couldn't find a single dustbin in the 3 km stretch. The road wasn't isolated though. I brought it home but have seen multiple garbage spots (corners in the road).

I think the garbage problem would be solved to a great extent if there're enough dustbins available. Hats off  to these people. But this will not improve anything in longer term.

If nearby people or Municipal is in habit of throwing garbage in this place, then they will continue to do it.

At this stage Indian government should impose heavy fines on people throwing garbage in public. Once the cycle of making the area dirty will stop, cleaning is not a big task I volunteered for two such cleanups in Gurgaon. I came to know about them through an FB page they created for Gurgaon chapter.. (just some 2-3 friend who started). Most of us didn't know each other but showed up at the spot. We cleaned for about 3 hours. We contributed 100 rs each for getting gloves and some basic equipment. The guys had coordinated with municipality to ensure what we cleaned was collected. Mooh bandh, Kam chalu was the mantra. We had 2 kids in the group too. We were quite icky and dirty by the end, but managed to share a cold drink amongst us. Went back really happy and satisfied! It was a good Sunday! Again, most people had heard about it through the Bangalore ugly Indian group and they just decided to bunch up and start. Heard similar stories from many other towns too. All you need is a bit of drive to make a change and handle some curious looks by passersby. I followed this group on fb, they paint walls/flyovers too. They painted this flyover in chennai and a few weeks later it was slapped with posters of movies and political parties.  All the world in dark and I'm hiding my light and judging others. Why don't I light up and show a hope Can’t wait for IT cell to post it on their pages and attributing it as an example of the success of Swach Bharat. BC why are we paying taxes if citizens have to do the dirty work of trash cleaning? AMA please Put a photo of some Gods as well.Will drastically reduce the waste. Amazing work. Count me in.  Hats off to you guys, well done. May be your efforts are too little in grand scheme of things but there's a proverb: ""if you gather sufficient dew drops you can create an ocean oneday."" I like how you painted the fences too. People will be more likley to keep it pretty if its already pretty. Good job people!! Bet the barrier wasn't erected in 3 hours. Until the government impose strict registration formalities on buildings by sort of waste disposal arrangements, if not then no registration or impose a tax which is reliable and cost of the government to carry and dispose or to transform. For people interested in the ""broken windows"" theory, there is a podcast and transcript: https://www.npr.org/2016/11/01/500104506/broken-windows-policing-and-the-origins-of-stop-and-frisk-and-how-it-went-wrong

Good to know that theory and what it actually is...  Point of order: If it were easy to find volunteers, the problem probably wouldn't exist. Partner with NSS units of local colleges.  Thank you so much for doing this.   Wow! Thats fucking amazing, Good Job you guys! That is what India needs!

India is being invaded by garbage and the scale of the problem has been overwhelming our garbage disposal services. In our country, household waste, construction waste, sewage and even industrial waste is blatantly disposed off into the environment, openly flouting government regulations. Many amidst us believe it to be our fundamental right to throw whatever we want wherever we want, and resent rules on this subject. Ambitious schemes like the “Swachh Bharat Mission” and “Namami Gange Programme” cannot succeed unless we, the people, change our mentality about cleanliness and take responsibility for the disposal of our garbage. Good work but what if I want to clean my city while staying anonymous means ugly infian can not show my face to public but still gets my help? I just now really needed to see some good in others thanks for this  Thats damn impressive
 WOW! Very very impressive. Kudos to them and may their tribe increase! Wow!  That is great!  That pile was not just an eyesore.   It probably made people sick Don't mean to find fault with your awesome work. But curious what happened to the plants (trees) in the before pic.   Cleanup initiative are not what are needed. The garbage will get re-accumulated in two or three days. Proper collection initiatives are the need of the hour, so that nobody throws garbage - the governments are not going to do anything. If you want to keep India clean you are gonna have to go home to home and collect garbage or even have a pseudo-government setup that fines people for polluting the environment around them as well as incentivizes clean ups and recycling.  Hey this is awesome!

1. How'd you discover the garbage? Was it through social media, or did you know of it before?

2. What difficulties did you face, if any? (A bit cliché, I know)

3. What was the interaction with the government authorities like?

Looking at a lot of the comments, TIL r/india doesn't want to clean public places.  So i am assuming people that don't pay taxes do this out of guilt? Considering, my first reaction was, ""I thought that's where my tax money was going "" Wait for 3 days and it would be same again. Lol The before picture is on the bottom.

Anyway this is by far the best social media hashtag challenge till date! Three cheers from Kolkata :) well done Great job OP....looking forward to visit the that soon... (From Dankuni) This is inspiring buddy. Keep it up. Not being a preacher but what needs changed first is the mentality of people in the way of civic sense. Unless that's in mind people will continue to do what they ae doing putting these amazing people's hardwork in vain Great work bro. I hope this spreads throughout the nation. What do you call the type of black mask he's wearing? you guys doing the God work here. Holy shit man!

This is not too far away from where I live.

Keep up the good work. Hope this spreads across the country and people learn some basic manners. Great work guys. Warmest regards from Sakherbazaar, Uttarpara. 😍 Highly appreciated OP! Great Job :) Well done guys - you are the real heroes Reminded me of Chandannagore Strand road! Every week spread boric powder there. Also own that patch of wall, keep it clean always, this will inspire others. This is amazing. So inspirational. Keep up the awesome work!! 👍🏽👍🏽 The biggest problem I face is the fogging of my glasses when wear them, especially like the one by the guy on the right Amazing work! Wait, Which party are you from? Amazing Great job! Side note: Post this on instagram / facebook as well. The trend is more likely to catch up over there. Respect incoming 🙏🏻 very cool Good job guys well done 👍👍👍👍 I'm from west Bengal too... Nice work.. Finally, something good out of West Bengal Nice Sure! Kudos keep the good work going guys ...... Heroes that we actually need Who cares about Swach Bharat when we have #trashtag? Good work.Btw were did you throw the trash OP? It's literally like cauterizing a gunshot wound when the bullet is still inside of you. 

I love how people selectively ignore India's contribution towards the carbon and methane emission problems.

Not trying to undermine your work here, just saying that there are other more important things which you should start to fight for along with this. Thank you for doing this! You guys look cute. All homo. I wonder why some people failed to show this level of enthusiasm with Swachha Bharat Programme. Salute to you sirs Big Respect guys. Oh man, that Jordan Peterson thing about cleaning up your room is getting out of hand! Abhinandan janai tomake Abhinandan! :) 

Also, cute couple. 😎 Aren't they promoting Modi's swachch bharat? is that allowed during elections? its good to see you doing what you are doing the only concern i have is that keeping our locality is basic stuff every human should do ...its our duty dont make it a instagram /facebook joke make it a lifestyle",Non-Political
"Actual footage of people trying to prebook Avengers: Endgame on BookMyShow since yesterday  Almost all tickets were sold out in Delhi one hour after advance booking opened. I couldn’t even open some theatres in bookmyshow. Movies gonna break records in India. Quality content. Gold do re isko koi. post this in r/marvelstudios r/highqualitygifs No one booked tickets for Hindi for the first hour because infinity war Hindi was a joke When you realize thanos does have a point when booking tickets for end game... :P Try hindi they are free XD Got mine for 27th 6:30 am If i had gold it would be yours. Aur jisne bhi spoiler diya uski faad di jaegi. I don't have gold so have a cupcake 🧁 or vadapav if you will First show in Chennai starts at 4:30 AM OP  TAKE A FUCKING BOW!!!!

THIS IS ABSOLUTELY, TOP TIER QUALITY!!!!! Gif is too real i spent 1 hour just to book a ticket lol Is there a limited number of theaters showing this, or what?  I anticipate the opening weekend in the US will be busy, but it's rare to book in advance for a movie, and unheard of for anything other than an opening.

Does this happen for highly anticipated Bollywood shows too?

I'm a bit surprised Avengers is doing this well in India, as there's a lot of backstory that you need for it to make sense.  Have that many people in India watched all the prior stuff? In my city, all seats except the first 2 rows in pretty much all the cinemas,  were sold out in less than 10 mins.

Paytm was the reason I could get some good seats for FDFS. I booked Friday tickets instead of Saturday like an idiot. If anyone wants Friday evening tickets for PVR Market City Pune, please PM. Good stuff! The End Tickets part was especially hilarious. Great editing! Luckily not many people watch in English in my city so 1st day shows are pretty free right now how many of you put this in your status? Sunday 7:30pm. Great Job. Booked my ticket for it AS SOON AS IT OPENED on paytm, got it in director's cut! I booked last night and still got them. Decent seats, a lil extra charge.

M cinemas here take some 🏅 THIS IS SO GOOD I chuckled when it said End tickets I got the last two tickets of the show, never been so excited in life, that also top row. Either someone payment failed or internet died or his/her friend got the tickets before them, so they bailed. Here have your thousandth upvote. Nice edit. Try another city 15 Lakh Gold ya 72000 silver logge? r/highqualitygifs You deserve gold you amazing bastard 😂😂 Last time I remember this happening was in 2012 for Dark Knight rises. So many new theatres have come up but still sold out!! What hype man!! can't believe it's coming to an end. It's been an amazing journey. Who are the people sitting in the first row all the way to the side.. all in favor for day 1 watch and not actually be able to enjoy the movie because the angle is absolutely horrendous...?!?! I am sorry little one This is awesome and soooo true bro.. paytm and Amazon pay had a lot of offers but none of them were processing the payment ... Ultimately managed to book without any offers.. felt it was an hoax.. anyone else managed to book with Amazon pay or paytm ??? 
Problem is if you try to watch after couple of days Reddit has to be avoided which I don't want to do .. Nice OC, just take my updoots fam Glad to see us generating some OG r/highqualitygifs I got Sunday tickets for imax 3d and that too I went to the movie theatre directly to book. So glad I can watch it tonight, I'm hyped as fuck I don't really have anything for or against any of the comicbook universes, but I stopped getting excited about these types of superhero movies a long time ago. I honestly don't know what so many people see in these movies any more. They are so formulaic and typical. And in these ones with the old heroes, you aren't even getting to see any new guys. OP have this poor man's gold 🏅 You guys are lucky. Cinemas are so cheap in India. I so wish I can see this soon. 10/10 editting This might me HQG material. [deleted] Thanks for uploading this awesome work to Gfycat instead of Reddit, or else I wouldn't be able to share this over WhatsApp. I was so determined and made  python script that checks the BookMyShow and Paytm each minute for my favourite IMAX theatre for the bookings to be open and hooked it to a Telegram bot to send me notification. And yes I got tickets ! Shit that's a lot of quality effort for a meme dude! r/HailCorporate Nicely done bro!

Am I the only one who doesn't give a shit about Avengers? friday last show :D r/marvelstudios Maybe use PAYTM instead. everything sold out , have to wait one full week , maybe more I got them in ggn. Khra sona hai ji Bought my tickets today on book my show. Damn they are selling like hot cakes. I got mine the day they where put on sale, cant imagine doing it now Good edit love it. High effort meme. Good job! Have got 6 tickets of endgame viviana mall(Thane,Mumbai) 3d hindi.. dm if anyone wants.. selling below retail price quality post have my upvpte Got mine for First day First show. 9 30 am top row. WOAH! This is awesome! 3d only. Fuck that shit. This edit is amazing 😍 Amazing....hope to see it this time in theater...couldn't see in 2015 because when avengers was released in late April we were facing our endgame with earthquakes What's the average demographic of the Marvel movie watcher like? I'm hoping it's people in their teens and twenties? Because growing up, nobody around me seemed to give a shit about them, and looking at these posts, it's like I live in a different world. Me and my friends got the first day first show tickets! Hell yeah spoiler: hollywood wins as always. My mom owns a shop in the mall where I'm going to watch, they agreed to give us tickets at the back row *In Tom Holland's voice* That's awesome,dude. lol..Got the tickets for the first day show. Why are they using MS Edge? Pretty sure that's why they couldn't book the tickets 😂. 

Also looks like am in the minority, do not understand what all this craziness is about, couldn't care less if I watched it after a month ( PS: have watched most of the marvel movies, so not a hater ✌️ 😄) Curious is this movie in iMax 3D? How much do their tickets cost? Lmao. I live near PVR Anupam. 😂 We'll watch the End Game..
Whatever it takes.. Holy fcuk, this was amazing. Someone post this on r/marvel I now agree with Thanos after checking for tickets. Heck too much of population. Hilarious gif. Trying since yesterday to book on pvr bangalore to no avail. Issues with the site. Is this OC? Also, did you post this in CCM group on FB? A post this to HightQualityGifs Am I the only one least bothered about Avengers? Where cN i download this video? I need this !!!! Its done! Figured! I conveniently booked tickets even after waiting 5-6 hrs after my desired show went up for booking.


There is rush but I dont think it is crazy at all. u/VredditDownloader u/SharkThug mirror gif please so we can share this outside of reddit. Also upload it on YouTube. So, is it safe to say that piracy won't hurt this movie?

"I stuffed most of Europe inside India  Sometimes I forget that India is the 7th largest country. We T H I C C! This lets one think how much of wasted productivity we have! Would love to see some stats on population too. Salesman: this country can fit so many other countries in it! Portugal should be near goa :p They don't call it a sub-continent for nothing. Did you adjust for the sq kilometers? Netherlands and Belgium does seem a bit big by the map I thought the UK was much bigger than it looks in here That's what I tell my friends that imagine every Indian state became a country of its own,  every country has its own history, language, clothes, food,  culture and many more such things, I think it would be easier to govern this small chunks of countries, or maybe if just our politicians didn't divide and rule us on basis of religion we won't need to this in the first place.

just a random thought that I always tell everyone. r/mapporn The funny thing is our country is as large and even more diverse than these countries. You: most of Europe. 


Balkans and Eastern Europe: Am I a joke to you? So Maharashtra and Gujarat would be France. Croissant as Phapda What kind of akhanda bharat is this?? This was t promised!!! Bihar is now Switzerland Remember back in the day when Europe *literally*  stuffed itself up our ass? U can stuff 2-3 South American countries as well. western europe Wish we had the gdp of all those countries combined.... ¿donde esta españa? This is barely half of Europe, if even that. Misleading title. My immature brain laughing at ""stuffed"". Honestly I always thought France was as big as Himachal Pradesh. I was miles off on that one. All I can think of is, why can we still not beat even one of them at Football. :( Good stuff OP!

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/4sk9ahX.png) is my take on this, with a couple more countries at the cost of small overlaps.

Attempted *some* cultural correlation.. (bracing myself for a culture war here)

Switzerland : the scenic place

Ireland : The land of Sardar jokes

U.K. : The land whose language everyone knows

Germany : Where engineers are produced by the ton (?)

Netherlands : The Goa of EU

Portugal : somewhere in the vicinity of Daman & Diu...

&#x200B;

\[Not all countries correspond\] Well they dont got the problem of population, pollution  and politicians ＼(◎o◎)／ I honestly didn't think India is that big lol That'll show em I see a blue dot in Sri Lanka, Is that a mistake? Czech Republic ko apna bana nahin paye aur inhe Kashmir chahiye 😂 You forgot half of Europe. Wish we could put quality of life too like this somewhere from them to us. I thought I was in r/mapporncirclejerk Actually south India should be United Kingdom 😂 That’s hardly all of Europe Wohich soch raha main ki kalse Mumbai me thandi jaisa lag raha Gotta love India and its crazy natural land and resources......amirite boizz!! UK^(2) Literal r/MapPorn History repeats itself yet again! You could make circle in a circle for better representation with whole area considered. Damn I knew UK was small but didn't think Germany was that small Akhand Bharat bitches. 😎

Edit: Level - Intercontinental I think you could shimmy Luxembourg, Vatican, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania somewhere in there... [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3R-rP8dawM) is quite relevant. Not sure if OP took this into account while making this.

Edit: Seems like OP did take it into account and made it using [this.](https://thetruesize.com) We should've at least won a couple football world cups. Theresa May, crying after seeing this. This was one of the reasons I always wanted a brexit Now put all of India in Russia... Polandine Patti oraksharam mindi pokaruth Czech Republic is an integral part of India This is wtf moment for me Czechs are stuck btw china and pakistan. You mean most of Western Europe minus Spain and Italy which constitutes a large land area. Scale them with their relative GDP. r/MapPorn Ok, now what? Isn’t Gujarat bigger than UK? :P Reminds me of that speech in Malgudi Schooldays. Jaisalmer is bigger than Belgium ! Andamans and Nicobar left out  :O Fuck, it was mostly the Brits in India originally. I don't like this new India.

Maybe this is a symbolic representation of slavery enforced by our current BJP government How dare you put Poland near Kerala. Wasted a lot of space in between tho... Could have fit in one or two more Hey, finally somebody didn't use the Australia map for Austria \[happy Austrian noises\] If we stop fighting amount ourselves, we can do better than all of them combined. Austria being horny af! Agra stuffs most of Europe into the Taj Mahal every day! 😂😂😂 Or as my ex would say: just another Saturday evening. Thanks ?... r/mapporn Hopefully people of Karnataka do squats as well Fun fact: Tokyo has got a population greater than Canada, let that sink in. Most of Europe? That's like 30% of Europe if that. Our country is one of wasted potential, we could easily be one of the most powerful, rich and developed countries yet we can't pull ourselves together and make a difference Did you resize the northern countries (like UK) to adjust for Mercator Projection? theres like 50 countires in europe and this is not even a half ""Most"". 12 out of 44 countries. Still got some space left mate?  India has more than four times the population of that combined. ""Most of Europe""

Includes 1 of the top 5 largest countries, 4 out of the top 15. Please Mr. Modi it's high time let's make Akhand Bharat happen, so we can fit more European countries  Spain is missing. Did you account for shrinkage? pretty sure you can squeeze in Luxembourg in Odisha Try bringing Russia too There are 44 countries in Europe, I can count 12 here. How's that 'most' of Europe? Also, obviously not all of them would have fitted but pretty sure you could fit more of the small ones in these gaps. And it would still not be 'most' of Europe. Now Kumbh will occur in France for Nasik with Bulls Race 🤣🤣🤣 how is 12 countries most of europe ? Did you stuff some in PoK? Is that allowed? Now fit in Russia ""Most of Europe""

&#x200B;

There is still space for Lichtestein, Andorra, Luxemburg, maybe Belgium though kudos to u my frnd Doubt the Swiss are too thrilled about being stuffed into Bihar That’s not most of europe! still you can fit Saudi Arabia in it You couldnt fit Swedorway in there? All of you do realize that it makes no difference if the country is this big if it has a billion+ people cramped in it, right? As women keep saying - size doesn't matter, it's what you do with it that matters Almost 25 percentage of China is  Tibet which is inhospitable. Luxembourg is too big for India /s Spain? You mean by geometry or by culture? And you placed Czech republic in Pakistan.... Look at the Azores lying out in the middle of nowhere, and Bornholm stuck to Jaffna. That's less than half of Europe. Not even counting European part of Russia. I get its a joke, but it's not a very good one. This is not even close to ""most of europe"" So you want Britain back in India, eh? Good god!

What have you done! Great......Now Europe smells. Jobless af Really like the fact that you didn't stick Sweden into this. Very wise of you 👌 I feel you could have added luxemberg, Monaco and Vatican city as well in Rajasthan or odisha Compare the population,you'll be astonished 😀 Lol, whyy though? Why did you take a chunk out of ireland Based on this I live in UK , thank you bro otherwise it's never gonna happen Alright, so as per you, currently, I am in France! Now I know why I always feel like a Frenchman. US bhi daal deta bhai; aise hi superpower ban jaate Most of western Europe maybe...always remember we have Russia wait... india's that big? r/dataisbeautiful We need Thanos r/nocontext Thanks, I had always wanted to go to United Kingdom. But these countries have far better roads and urban planning. Our cities are haphazardly growing whixh is not any good. We need more planned cities.

Btw the maps are based on the Mercader projection which preserves shapes and direction but distorts the size of the countries heavily and thats why you can't compare sizes of counties using Mercader projection.

Projection is used because earth is a sphere and this map is a plane surface. There are different projections but mercader is used widely because it provides accurate direction for navigation and preserves the shape of countries. Why? All your citizens are not worth 1 person from, lets say, the UK, France, or Germany. Czech Republic is outside if I may say so. This looks nice and all but ... why?",Non-Political

Thirty-two-year-old Bharat Bhushan Gupta is the man who reported the matter of illegitimate Aadhaar data access to The Tribune, which was followed up by the paper with an investigation of its own, aided by this whistle blower.
Aadhaar Bridge, a product of Khosla Labs that was promoted by Raghavan, Nadhamuni and Jain, counts Hero Motors, Samsung, Ola, Hinduja Leyland .
Pandey said the Unique Identification Authority of India is vigilant about data breaches and citizens should not be too concerned even if their Aadhaar numbers are leaked. True, People are not ready to understand and listen anything against aadhar. Some fail to understand that it is surveillance technology and many try to justify the need of surveillance. Remember the engineer who blew the whistle on Golden Quadrilateral? The one who ""committed suicide"" ? Whistle blowers are generally given a blow where it hurts.  # #DestroyTheAadhaar So, India's little Snowden?

All the deals will be given to the farmer who made this product . Amazing guy Very smart! I assume this is for coconut and palm trees only. What if you run out of battery in the middle of the climbing.😅 What if the surface of the tree trunk is not smooth? Is this still safe then?

Edit: to those downvoting, I mean if you want your coconut and arecanut plantations to last for only 20 years or so go for it. I am from Mangalore. This kind of thing was already invented way years ago. Why it didn't become popular? Because no farmer wants to risk damaging their plantations. The talent our country has is immeasurable.

P.S. Any other place where you can share these? I don't use Facebook. They're really nice! Really nice. Make more. Put them in r/comics.

You have a great clear style and good material. 
 A little bit of constructive criticism, I think a few more beat panels could help the flow.  Great stuff. The best thing I liked is the mixture of skin complexions you are using. Truly represents the diversity in our country.It's time we get rid of the lighter-complexion-mania.

Also, try showing people with different heights, hairstyles, disabilities, etc. engaged in regular conversations. Just a suggestion.

Keep going, Bud(Or Buddini if you are a lady)!! Fucking excellent! Ha!!!
Great stuff Keep up the good work. We need more of this. Liked ur fan page :) Haha that's going to put me off from malu aunty's atleast for a week. These are really very good op. Excellent work. Need more man. Find this shit even funnier coz i can relate to the situations. Much like! Please make more.  good effort. I just think the jokes were a bit tired.      Super awesome  Love it! And would love to see more. Very good - enjoyed them. Funny and very Indian. Looking foward to more  Laughed out loud, the expressions and postures are spot on, would love to see more This is very good, OP! :-) Relatable... good stuff OP.. keep at it Good stuff. Wire fan?  Not bad OP, I dig your drawing style. You should really consider getting your own domain + webcomic CMS up and running soon. Pretty sure you'll be a big hit! My younger brother lives with me....the last one is true lol....but im the one who sits naked.. 🙋   Are you aware of, or associated with the brown paper bag girls from Mumbai? 

Otherwise you may need a new name. I love these! Sharing these to my friends. I look forward to more of them ^^ This was amazing. Keep up the good work! I would love to see more. dayum!  

Do you have a website yet? please get one. This stuff is nice! :D 

You've earned have a follower. If only it was tied up with some strings,  it would be my favorite thing. :-) Awesome. Waiting for new ones! Nice! OP tell us how you are feeling right now , with such a positive reaction here :)  Hey. Subscribed to you on FB. Really like your work. Maybe consider putting up a logo on your cartoons or atleast a website address, for people who find your cartoons in the stray.

Do you hand-draw them or do you do these digitally? I just followed you on FB! Love it! Hilarious. Do you have an rss link? Probably more political than cultural but this  [series ](http://crocodileinwatertigeronland.tumblr.com) should count. I'm here via /r/all and I am from the UK (I took some time out from running around screaming in panic to browse reddit). 

I love these comics so much and wish you every success. They're well drawn, really funny and the humour crosses international boundaries, even though here in the UK we don't have the 'birthday treat' thing. The first one cracked me up  I love your cartoons. Keep doing the good work.

One piece of advise, avoid political stuff, regionalism and other crap. We live in a country where we love to ban stuff. steer clear of all controversial stuff. keep doing cartoons based on relationships, jobs etc.

Whenever you release a book, i will buy it.

all the best to you.

 this is great. funny relatable and cute characters. Indians need more of this sort of thing for younger generations; for some reason unlike east asia and the west we've yet to develop our own presence in modern comics / toons that cater to young adult generation. 
great work.

I enjoyed them! Keep it up! :) OP! THIS IS FUCKING GOLD! THE FIRST ONE IS SO GOOD!! Really good job! Only small criticism is mom looks too young. I am interested in learning doodling/comics and few questions . 

How can I start learning it ? 

Will I need any specific tools ? 

Would I be good fit If I am not good at drawing ?

What are some good online courses you would recommend ?

These are very funny This is real good! Each of them made me laugh! Hope you keep making more of these.  Into my Favorite & forget dumps Huh funny my birthdays end up the same except I'm drunk & instead of birthday bumps it's a bar fight  These are great! I especially commend you for doing satire without getting political! Make a book. I'd pay money and keep it on my chai table for the Sharma unkils and auntys.  Ohh shit, these are awesome. Please carry on making them, and update this thread with a website, possibly. You know, there may actually be space for these comics in newspapers. I liked it. I liked the 1st and the 4th one. The 4th one is super btw. 
I think the first 2 were preachy and are talking about the same indian hypocrisy issue that everyone from aib to my facebook friends talk about. We dont need another voice for it. Especially if its just gonna be doing it in the same way. Unless you bring something new to the table its pointless. 
Though you shouldnt stop saying what you want to say if you really feel that you need to get it out. 

The 3rd and 4th were personal, real identifiable and charming.. Excellent

On a side note.  Maybe look for another skin tone brown. I feel we are typecasted as this tone in everything depicting an indian..i cant help but think of apu from the simpsons. Maybe look for your own shade. 

I always felt that i couldnt get into animated stuff too much cuz the characters were never shaded and had to tones and hence never felt real. 
I would have really liked to see that. And I felt your lines were too clean and computerized. A little sketchiness would be great imo. Do you draw on paper too?  2/10.

The last one 6/10. Sooo... It's the same as any other comics with brown skin and Indian names? Why not make them Danish? Or South African? Make some Indian jokes maybe? way too political for me.

"Found at a hospital in India.  In order to avoid this, doctors at some hospitals will only treat you once money has been deposited at the payment counter. The worst experience of my life was running from counter to counter to make payment while my friend lay unconscious outside of emergency department while the ambulance guys smoked a ciggy, and the doctors wouldn’t even touch him till he was “admitted” I.e had fees paid.  > When enemies knock on the door

> The soldier is looked upon as God

> When he accepts the challenge

> He is looked upon as an angel

> When he returns home after doing his duty

> He is looked upon as a common man

> When he asks for OROP

> He is looked upon as a devil.

I have invoked the soldier. Argument over. 

 I work in an E.R in Southern California and I’ve found the way they work to be really weird. 

If you arrive by ambulance, A doctor will see you initially to make sure you’re stable. After you’ve been registered (my job) we check to see which doctors are covered by your insurance. That will decide what surgeons/specialists/hospitalists you will have access to. 

Sometimes you won’t be covered at our hospital at all and I will call an ambulance to take you to a hospital that will take your insurance. 

You will always receive emergency treatment at any hospital, but as soon as you’re deemed stable your level of care is determined by your insurance. 

 man Indians are good with words.... Applies to pretty much anything, IMO. 

For instance, when someone is in need of money, they look at you in the best light possible when you help - then later, when you ask to settle, you are probably the worst person possible who is keeping track of petty cash. 

Just some quirks of human nature, I guess.  Same with lawyers.

Have a legal problem? Lawyer is your God.

Are you at fault and is all the evidence against you? Lawyer is a common man.

Do you want to avoid paying fees? Lawyer is the devil.

It's no surprise that many lawyers have been taking fees upfront. There's just no gratitude.  Yes , its true. Doctors are given a name 'a Second god' , as he gives another life to a person who is hanging between life and death. But sometimes it happens that he is termed as a devil when he fails to save a life of a human. You have been banned from r/LateStageCapitalism I don't think anyone has problem paying fees to the doctor, people have problem with the ridiculously high hospital fees.   

And all this is due to the stupidity with hospitals and doctors creating the fake high bill if you have a mediclaim, their explanation being you don't have to pay the insurance company does. The problem is when everybody does the whole medical industry is affected. Truth!! but then some doctors do behave like devils, while charging patients

edit: why the downvotes? I specifically said **some** doctors, not all. That being said I have had personal experiences of both good and bad doctors.  Some Med students nowadays pay around 1 crore to get a medical seat...i'm not sure many of them would choose to be an Angel type Doctor Reading this the opposite direction, that is bottom to up, it also conveys the same message. Okay, bye.  This is how the super animal (human being) behaves. For a second there, I thought the title read ""Found a hospital in India"". People offer laddoos to god. Will our doctor god accept 1 kg of ladoo? 

There are many good doctors.

But Docs in metros are modern day dacoits. Offering procedures that are not required.

 God and Devil are different sides of same coin. Thats why everyone should invest in Health Insurance. Same for Lawyers (i.e. Solicitors who get business from the Layman as opposed to Barristers/Advocates/Counsels who only deal with Solicitors and thus are valued for their service). True story of every Doctor. When he starves you with debt and curses your family with what's left, he's look upon as the devil. Doctors don't save people for the sake of money. They do it because they feel that it is their calling to help people. A doctor could live in a little shack and only eat bread and water every day and still feel accomplished because he saves people.

At least this is how it should be. Otherwise you get a health care system where only the rich are treated.  [deleted] On the other hand:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCxxcXnnvs Hangs this board and yet writes costly medicines instead of generic ones and over that, those medicines won't be available anywhere in the market except at the shop next to the clinic. Mother of coincidence, isn't it? [deleted] **And at the end a Man shows his true face ** if aim is only money making then its wrong , otherwise its a good profession.  Patients die after they saw the medical bill.so doctor is a devil indeed. Wo sab toh theek hai lekin how come no one is talking about Virushka here?  nice nice

good to know that some doctor's association has paid $h!ll$ over here

instead of investing that money in improving patient care and reducing its cost, the money is going in trying to influence people into thinking that doctors are ""gods"" and they deserve their pound of flesh",Non-Political

Nothing is today morning Not mine as there is no DTH or Cable since 2014 in my home . And that was the best decision my family ever took cuz the News channels have gotten shit since and there has been a rise in streaming services ( which have no ads ) , so I don't have to worry about missing on any HBO or a good movie. 

Plus , lot more silence and peace at home without the constant bickering in the ads and the shouting in the so called ' debates '.

Edit, pasted from below: 

I want to maximise the cleanliness of my teeth for as long as possible.

So I wake up, eat breakfast and coffee and then brush my teeth so that they are at least clean till lunch and so I don’t stink of coffee.

And most importantly my breakfast doesn’t taste like shit. So you're saying women don't go to office and have to be a slave to the man (iron his clothes and dress him up etc.) while he watches TV? Huh? You sexist guy! Hahahhaha... True 😂😂😂 I am refusing to give exam today.",Politics

Did she immolate herself and later thought its better by the rope around her neck. What kind of monsters are these ""powerful"" people. I got pics. Didn't post it because it was really brutal. I feel sad that people who did this got away with it with such ease. I think you should give a little more detail if you want people to take this seriously - which place exactly, who are these bad guys? etc. this looks suspiciously like one of those Whatsapp posts circulating all over the place, no offence bro but please provide details. [removed] There is a petition on change.org demanding justice for the girl. It is shocking that the police have turned a blind eye to this horrific crime. Hope she gets justice.

And this is a major issue that for some reason hasn't found traction on any Media.

Also, please sign the petition to force the authorities to take the necessary actions. We live in a democracy whose Moto is to serve the people, but here we are begging for justice.

CHANGE.ORG PETITION LINK: http://chng.it/r2kYSTxk How can i help? Some people tend to barbecue themselves while hanging I suppose, I'll give the 'suicide' points for creativity there. Sadist fucks hope someone flays them alive. For all those who are wondering if this is legit or not, #justiceformadhu is trending on twitter. Recent updates states the culprit who was found guilty has been arrested today evening, further proceedings have been going on! We need all your support to ensure he gets execution for this cruelty! Will keep posted on further updates! Thanks to everyone who supported and have been supporting! Special thanks to sri umesh kamble sir for investigating the case and arresting the culprit within 24hrs! (Copied) Police and local MLA can help. (if MLA doesnt goto the opposing party , to make it public issue) Found one article https://metrosaga.com/a-girl-in-raichur-was-brutally-raped/ Posts on social media mention that she was raped and burnt to death. The media doesn't seem to be bothered. Have there been any comments on it from the local leaders yet? It's sad that this still happens and I know it won't stop in future either. Sometimes it just feels like that the punishment should be same as the crime. how is this story any less than Nirbhaya, The Media is so fucking biased, This world Dying Slowly but surely. Politics is killing Our country And Bollywood has a huge role in doing so, Education System is shit here(No sex Education).
If this goes unpunished, I'll loose my faith On the system. Fuck Modi fuck Gandhis Fuck Every Politician. That’s gruesome! My prayers are with her family. Lets get this post on trending to get max attention I can understand that media has no conscience left but Police? Fucking Police turning a blind eye to such gruesome crimes is atrocious. Completely fucking ridiculous. Anything we can do to help? You can commit any crime while elections are going on, it's almost guaranteed that it won't be covered by the media.

If yes, we should all file RTI asking for their investigation notes and FIR and everything related to the case. If that is public, we might be able to do something right?

Still, I will do what I can. https://twitter.com/IamViruLover/status/1118945443046498304?s=19 I wonder how many such hidden murders take place and get hushed up, never to see the light of day. I wonder how many of those happen in the city we live in, or even the vicinity where we live. Very disconcerting This case , jet airways issue I see nothing important being coverd by mainstream media. We need independent creators who can put up a voice in YouTube or Facebook and have a significant following to be impactful. >Its very much clear that its a planned murder.

No. It is NOT clear. I'm not saying that this couldn't be true but come on, you have no evidence. How do you KNOW that this is true? Photos of body are not a proof. That is proof she is dead, not that she was murdered.

>No other reason for her to commit suicide.

You seem to have a misconception that study is the only reason people commit suicide.

Why should I believe this and I share it? How is this better than any WhatsApp forward claiming something. how the fuck can someone commit suicide by burining and then hanging herself? sham Saw the photos...damn..The people who have committed this heinous crime deserve no salvation. you all are right my bad Everyone should tweet about this. Tag all the K'nataka officials. i dont see a reson why the media should be blames. i I we need to blame some one it is the police and the investigation unite along with the judicial stem if they have failed to get justice done. Nothing has changed after Nirbhaya, even if 10 men disrobe a woman and gang rape her in broad daylight on a busy road - even then there will be a crowd to watch the spectacle and not help the victim.

"Pic From Rural Kerala  Couldn't slide the saturation slider more?  [deleted] The composition is nice.!!!
The edits not so much.
Vibrance is way to high. needs more color, saturation and contrast /s Straight out of an RPG Way to ruin a pic God's own photo editor! Let not the experts shit on your enthusiasm. Many people liked the photo. It pleased more eyes than it didn't. It didn't pass the scrutiny of some randians because nothing short of perfect is acceptable if others are doing it. It's a tough world when everyone is an expert. You may have gone a few extra mms on the saturation slider but now you know. Every photographer worth his salt understands the limits of their camera's sensor and knows when and how much saturation to add. You'll learn it too. The composition is nice. Keep at it. You will never be short of people looking to bring a person on their way up down. You'll find most of them lack any creative skills themselves. All they possess are skills to critique because life behind a screen feels very brave and secure.  I think a lot of amateur photographers find it necessary to go over board with saturation. I try to understand this need. But it just feels like they’re compensating for lack of vision or because they feel that more colors means better photo?
A good photo carries its weight in framing, composition and story. Don’t kill it with a need to compensate. This photo would have been just fine with normal saturation. I don’t get why everything needs extra cheese. 

Sorry for the rant I’m having a bad day.  I don't think it will look like this in real life. Looks something straight out of *lord of the rings*. Is everyone on Randia fucking retarded? All the recent pics have saturation to the max. We get it that you don't understand photography and just want it to look good. Tbh even normal saturation would look good. Having distractions like these make a photo bad. Saturation : **MAX** Is this ~~r/India~~ Instagram? Awesome click dude Surreal So many on here talkin about the vibrance. May I have shit taste, I like it. :) I personally think it's frigging awesome.. I'm a simple man I see beauty I upvote.. lol been there kerala has the nicest scenery Nice Pic from rural I see ramdev in the clouds.

https://imgur.com/a/a1qosQk Ah there was a time when I did this... two or three cows, bare-chested old man (who was my dad's uncle), bare-chested, pigeon-chested me in shorts, and an aging german Shepherd walking the cows to his land where they graze till evening. A river was there but not so closeby, hills were packed with rubber trees and not blue but green... this was late 70s, early 80s. Snapseed off the chain yo. Gods own country Namudde Keralam! [Fixed the image for you OP](https://vgy.me/ICbA3O.jpg)  
 proud to be malayali That's breathtaking! poor slave souls..  :( Great shot👍 Randians pointing out the obvious saturation and not knowing normal unedited pics never make to the first page Wow! Thats a great image.

Does reddit compress images? Nice pic  of Rural Kerala............that awesome Woah <3 nice Which place is this? Want to visit it Beauty! Looks surprisingly wide. Don't fuck with me. That's so not Kerala.
But I'll believe you :)
Amazing photography  Stunning photograph...what camera / phone did you use for this? Can you post a high resolution version for a wallpaper? God this looks beautiful from my iPhone in my air conditioned office.  I just edited few things (reduced the exposure a bit, change the colour temperature slightly and reduced saturation). The image still looks good but the colours don't look fake here

"Just a photo of HP Petrol Pump I took recently. The line drawing is added in PS later. [OC] 3922x4902  Checked your insta, great stuff man keep it up. [removed] If you like my work, you can check my IG too. @xtermist Lol for a moment I thought I was on /r/lowpoly.

&#x200B;

Great pic, the line work give it a nice balance effect. Why don't you sell this photo to HPCL? It's really good. They can use it for advertising or something Getting Watchdog vibes.... great shot! Looks dope. Be careful though. Corporations and people might steal this and use it as their own. Kinda retro neon theme going here. I like it Never imagined I'd say that a Petrol Station would look snazzy, but, this one does. Kavinsky-Night Call This is really amazing Sell it to them! Thanks I'm making this my wallpaper I can hear Daft Punk in the background. Unrealistic. 

Where are the 3-4 people who sit on chair and talk and then tell you - Bhaiya band h,  mat aao


And you cry because you were so happy you found a pump at night ☹ You should mail it to hpcl. They can give you credit and use photo on their website or somewhere else Dope. Good digital art. That's creative man /r/Outrun vibes Dude that's dope Stunning! 

OP can you run through the basic steps. Camera and the software you used for the edits other than PS. Did you use light room by any chance? Lol nice Post it on r/pics That drawing takes this picture to a whole new level. i thought it was r/simulated 
such a neat work man, keep it up! you can share this pic to r/photoshopbattles btw awsome work on the floor really love to see more !! Good stuff, /r/VaporwaveArt and /r/outrun would probably enjoy this too I up voted just for the lines.. that's a good idea to make use of empty space which would have ended being cropped if it was my edit.. This will be    a   e   s   t   h   e   t   i   c    in the future when electric vehicles dominate. CYBERPUNK 2077 Looks SICK.. really impressed Love the work, dropped a follow on your IG. Looking forward to more content like this! HP should pay you for doing such an amazing work... They could use it in their ads. Good job bro .. it's looks like something out of Tron . I worked with HPCL,  will share this with folks in headquarters Bruv this is awesome Great stuff, man A E S T H E T I C Can’t relate cause cause afford petrol. 
Also, don’t have a vehicle. Looks sick mate That looks lit! Minus the flames though! Looks cool. Reminds me of Twin Peaks weirdly I honestly feel the picture would have been much better if the lines hadn't been drawn. Otherwise it's a top quality picture. Loved it man, keep up the good work. 
On a side note, release the picture somewhere online without the lines and it will make a crazy desktop wallpaper. Cyberpunk *_* Cool work. Is this the petrol pump at Hosur Mcd? The Abyss Petrol Pump. Wow! If that light cracking out of the floor was under the Indica it would be rad! 😎 Very atmospheric and well composed. I like without the lines as well. Great work op. I don't get the purpose of the lines. The photo is nice. The lines are weird Bantai logg idhar pr music vedio bnaenge Why a Petrol pump? This photo says that I'm the worst photographer.

"The Times Of Modi!  Are you telling me ToI sells every alternate page for ads. This video is a very accurate representation of Indian politics right now.  This is what death of journalism looks like. State sponsored ads are the obituaries of today's journalism.


#Subscribe to independent & transparent news portals. NOW. Times of India is the ""Facebook"" of newspapers Shouldn't there be some oversight as to where this party is getting all this money to splurge? Why waste money on fixing the country, when you can spend money on convincing the people that you're fixing the country.  TOilet paper? This is the reason why media houses love this government. Any advertising by government agencies should not have elected officials photographs in it Why people still buy TOI is above me Did anyone read that article about the woman from Turkmenistan dying in a car accident? It literally ended with ""<car model> is the fastest in the world.""

They mentioned the make and model of the car more times than they did the victim. And the article was like 300 words tops. Ridiculous. When I'm in India I see his face so much that he disturbs my dreams too OP, Are you paying money for TOI?

I wish TOI sold its paper in roll form and with waterproof ink. i think election commission should be wrapped up and thrown in garbage. its a mockery of democracy Why is everyone dissing on TOI?  They are not gonna deny the money coming their way. The fact that the government is spending for multiple page ads is simply boiling my blood. How can there be people who still support this manic?  All that money wasted... In Delhi, if there is a full page ad of Modi, there's a full page ad on Kejriwal on the next page.  The Times of Propaganda, more likely.  From this, I've got a lesson in entrepreneurship, no matter how bad the product is, all that matters is promotion. Even my Malayalam newspaper had similar ads Into the Modi-verse  This is why The Hindu is the best. They still have some integrity left. They're like the NDTV of newspapers According to https://timesofindia.releasemyad.com/display-ad/main-newspaper

Price for  display ad in delhi 3935 rs/sqcm

Area of a newspaper page around 1716 sqcm

1716  x 4400 = 75,50,400

There were easily more than 10 complete pages of ad. OP here...

[Guess this would answer a lot of questions!](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pm-modi-spent-humongous-1-billion-on-ads-and-foreign-trips/i-got-money/slideshow/67105770.cms?from=mdr) Is this real? Thank God I haven't bought a newspaper in decade.  This is resembling cultish characteristics... Looking at this shit as, an outsider, you'd probably think this is a dictatorship  I wonder if this is how Germans would have felt in 1936. Sadak me gadda hai? Ya gadde me sadak? hahahahah Holy fuck Now I know where my tax money goes. Goes into making me believe that they're doing something.

&#x200B; mr india

da fuq We have a Donald Trump of our own. There is need for subscibtion base media like Netflix where people will pay for  good jornalism. If revenue model is based on Advertisement then any political party can rigg media like above. Future investors / VCs please consider my request Atleast he didn't launch the new Honda Civic, which was on the last page of TOI today.  Modi Propagenda 💯 Somebody file a case against our pm for using tax payers money to promote people to vote for him like they did to indira gandhi in 1975. ""Chaap kar bikte the jo akhbar aaj bik kar chaap rahe hai.""

rough translation : ""Newspapers which used to be printed and then sold, now they are getting sold before printing."" What a piece of human excrement. Parasitic pedo boy fondler! That's where my fucking tax money goes! I hope to God if he exists that someone kills this motherfucker. I rather he do ads than start wars to get re-elected  How much of my tax money is used by the government and BJP to jerking off themselves in front of the mirror ?  This is giving 1984 feels Chowkidar ke baap ka paisa hai kya?  Complete Waste of Public Money. All the ruling parties do this. Wish there was some law against this.  News kaha Hai BC? I guess the problem is that neither political party in India is generally positive and good for India. They are both corrupt and refuse to deal with social issues properly. but...the MSM is against modi. So modi has to buy ad space to have any postiive news about himself! /s Wait till they accuse AAP of spending 500 crore on Advertisement! My mother and brother got a call from AAP, they were saying that modi sarkar has removed around 2500 voters name from voters list(in our area) and kejriwal is fighting for our voting rights... I was wondering if this is true or just one party accusing another to increase their vote bank? now i know why i didn't get my 15lakh rupees yet Naveen Spotted I wish someone places a RTI to know who pays for the Ads. This is such a blatant misuse of money. What news agency do you think are unbiased today in india? I sometimes wonder where the money for these promotions comes from. 5000 crores on party advertisements damn Did not realise people still read TOI I counted 16 pictures of the PM in ads. There is (I think) 1 small inset of NaMo in the real news sections and one cartoon. There are 3 pictures of Rahul Gandhi in the news sections and he is present in the TOI masthead. 

TOI just balanced journalism.  Hey you psss sort by controversial  This is what cancer looks like. iiittttsss modi time! Where does the money come from?  Is it through donations or through the tax payers' money?  And what is the legality of using public money for publicity before elections?   World's largest demock...... This thoughtcrime is double plus ungood  Fuck man!! This newspaper is still a piece of shit.
I considered it to be quite Anti- Modi/BJP/right wing kind off or leftist as some term it but what I can see is that money can do anything...🤯🤣🤣. Oh all I can summarise is Modi and Namumkin hai.. it does relate at all! 😄 It's pretty common for most govts before elections.  At first I was disgusted but midway through the gif, I wanted to see the streak continue till the end. Nahi nahi modiji ne accha Kiya.
/s You got some free news from your daily subscription of advertisement. George Orwell flashbacks So, are these adverts paid for by public funds? Vomit When they were asked to bend, they started crawling.  ...""Ye Bik Gayi Hai Gormint""... It's sad that we have a leader who believes in adverts rather than being industrious Same for Hindustan Times Oh boi you guys really are like Pakistan under N-league in their last term. Spending more on ads than on the projects themselves.  Modi era is like watching Nazi-week at history channel: 
Nazis had propaganda team - IT Cell.
Nazis blamed Jews and democratic  govt - BJP blames muslims and Congress.
Hitler was termed as savior and God - So Modi.

Oh... God let's my country awake. Somebody has got some serious marketing budget.

A single full page ad costs lakhs. Watch republic tv. Same thing man.  next level of advertisement  Actually, that's quite likely  He's like god at this point. HE'S EVERYEHERE!  Only one page for Naveen pattnaik, poor BJD!!! Modi 2019 💯💯💯 I think it was Filter Copy which made a hilarious video on it on Facebook. Might be worth it to check Because he is desperate to come back to power Pathetic  Didn't know Modikaka has done so much for India. Literally har ghar Modi  BJP has a solid funding, when you're paying in crores for Ads, which sellout media won't be interested in that? Every local newspaper in my area also has same issue. Every morning I have to see this guy's face like I've already haven't got enough. Smh  I love my country, I want a leader who is capable of handling both internal n external affairs, modi of course good in handling external affairs but he is not aware of inner mites  📞 Hello, media regulator? 📞 I'd like to report a complaint 📞 TOI is interrupting my Ad brochure with News 📞 Keeping Modi in power seems profitable for TOI... soon they don't need to print news. Why news is present in Advertisement paper ? Just wondering, is that a major newspaper of India?

Who pays for these advertisements? u/vreddit_bot Indian print media is shit My dad is not changing from TOI. 

Forget that, he's watching Republic TV cause it's free (Only saving grace is he isn't watching Arnab)  Journalism dead ? Why do you even read that trash newspaper Why do you read trash magazines? That's clearly not a newspaper. Newspapers have *cue gasp* NEWS in them.  Look at that, that is our hard earned money. And we thought it was being used used in education and to build roads and infrastructure. TOI desperately wants him back for next 5 years?the question is why? Modi is fulfilling his promise by creating jobs in the media industry  Guys, WhatsApp is not allowing to send this video is there any reason behind it? Its like Times of India starts from a page 7 or 9.  And even after that It has this in all its pages.  I like how on the 3rd photo you just pan out like-""Another one!"" Fuck, my taxes are paying this! Despite having cancelled my ToIlet subscription. Is it all from the same day/date? can OP verify with dates on each page? to me it looks like dubiously put together from multiple days  It like seeing someone over 100 times 

if anyone ask who is he 

""ye to apna he bhai hai"" Indian express 11 full page color I see all that black money in ads I have a game. Drink a shot of tea every time you see a Modi ad. It would be fun. Going full Putin now Children in Africa could have eaten food for the money spent here.... Wait.... Children in India could have eaten some food  When you have only one friend in your college to fill your scrapbook.  [Times of Modia]

That’s how literally our media is:( When your rule is so good that you need 14 ads in the countries top ""news""paper to convince the population. I agree... Would anyone suggest a better, more neutral newspaper please?  I see OP is from Odisha. I worked for India s leading Media firm and what I learn is  ads are ""Bribe"" to suppress some stories or Push others.  Journalist literally thretan to local business for  ads or they'll report their business inapproprities. Specially real estate.   Fuck me how much money is thwt Tbf they're ads after all Media houses preach modi *mild shock* This is wrong and should be stopped. AAP is posting full page ads everyday in HT Delhi edition.
Also TOI is garbage. Switch to HT,The Hindu etc. Gujarat, you gandu, you have to answer for this infamy. And for that ugly ass statue. As if petrol pumps were not enough All that is with my tax money?  BC sabka saath sabka Vikas had me in split rn..  Thanks for buying their advertisements..  The next will be Jio phones that will only have one ringtone - “Wah Modiji Wah” Bhai kya hai ye!! Did you just repost Atul Khatri? WHAT?! This is what today's Bhubaneswar edition of The New Indian Express looks like.
Replace ModiJi with PatnaikJi and the P in BJP with the D of BJD. 


Governments need to be regulated about the usage of their departmental marketing budgets.  r/welovemodi 
/S Except Ravish kumar every other journalist is sold. If u want to see the true condition of the country you can only rely on NDTV. What the actual fuck. It's the look at all the shit we pulled in the last 4 years that you clearly missed season  Had they spent half the time they spent creating these tacky ads on actually reporting the truth, their credibility wouldnt have seemed questionable.  times of India readers, good luck with that This can't be real. ~~video seems to be blank now?~~  
nvm just my gpu dying thats all Modi done nothing in his time period. Why peoples support modi. I don't know why. I am not said vote for Congress or any other party atleast you should choose the right person and an educated person for the PM post. When we are going for an interview or we want to passed the Class we did our preparation for the exam or interview. Our next pm will also select on that basis not the typical politics ritual. bjp invest the max in marketing than any other company comes

&#x200B; [removed] Yes people blowing their heads over purchased newspaper ads to show BJPs ideas and public Benefit schemes in an election year. How else are poor people supposed to learn about opportunities offered for them.  

Did you show the same level of disgust last 60 years the Congress named countless roads and structure after the Gandhi family name to continue their “legacy”. Which shows more hunger for power?  https://youtu.be/c1eZbrt19zg
here is an exposé done by the Cobrapost on the times group where they admit they've been working for BJP,but the irony is bhakts call TOI as an anti-hindu newspaper I'm reading Kejriwal Times in Delhi everyday Yeh bik gyi hai media Anyone spotted Naveen Pattnaik ? Lol I thought they were pro congress or rather anti Modi cos in the Kolkata edition, all we see is pics of didi.  Agressive marketing strategy 😂 The fuck is this? Those small billboards on the road repeating every few meters are more pleasant than this shit. Who is more pathetic here?? 
Politician  or the press I really don't get the 'modi hate' he is actually doing something good for country. Why do soo many people hate him? I genuinely don't get it  I wipe my ass with TOI 50 Shades of Modiji..!! More like Times of Shit!!! Probably schools will introduce a course on Modi Bro don't want to see all this. Give some good stuff. Tired of seeing this man's face. Please don't litter reddit as well. Already the india subreddit is sad.  Everyone is detesting the fact that advertisements on newspapers. As if it's something new. The fact is, how will the newspapers stay afloat with out giving ads? Half of y'all complaining don't even subscribe to newspapers any more- rather watch news online. So what are you guys expecting? BJP has marketing money to spent- they are spending and that is nothing wrong. Period. This is actually hilarious Serious question: Do young people read newspapers? I can't get myself to touch one since a while now. They are beyond pathetic.  Yep, been trying to get my family to unsubscribe but they even give me reasons like they 'like the horoscope' SMH Well, elections are round the corner! Times of India:  Toilet Paper!!! There's in-your-face evidence for the ruling party spending **STUPID** amounts of money on campaigning.

Any other democracy, and this would've triggered judicial measures by the Election Commission against BJP.
 JUST SO YOU KNOW ->>>>>>  ONE PAGE ADVERTISEMENT COSTS Rs. 7 lakh guys. Indian democracy died the day BJP voted in the anonymous foreign donations law in parliament. ```FLYING FOR ALL``` Hey OP, which city edition is this? Delhi? What is the date? The Indian government has way too much power and unchecked. We need a stronger justice system to prosecute such actions. An independent investigation body that can investigate such acts. Campaign finance should be capped, no? How are they able to spend as much as they want? (That too presumably taxpayer money) Upsc students: When you open the newspaper to cover Current affairs but end up learning only the govt schemes part of it:( If given enough money, times will even publish articles praising terrorist groups. its such a sellout...  But chutiya Gambhir only sees Kejriwal in this.  ~~Big Brother~~ Mota Bhai is watching MODI ......    MODI......  MODI.......  MODI ................. Aw fuck That's the TAX PAYER MONEY.. Congress would have done the same if in power. They are all the same.  Pay to keep news free This reminds me of 2013-2014 where I saw billboards and advertisements of Samsung everywhere!! Eventually I ended up buying it  Love him or hate him. He’ll be in your face and you can’t do anything about it.  Oh damn I was just about to post this today Tum mujhe NEWS do mai Tumhe Adverisements dunga.

\--56 inchs The sad thing is that some people won't know the difference between news articles and advertisements. And they will get influenced by the ads thinking that it is news articles. \>What you doing bhai?

<reading ads Thats a 3 USD subscription, mind sharing some screen grabs? Same shit every day of this week in Deccan Herald. ☹️ Looks like the entire newspaper is Classifieds. BJP is digging its own grave with these ads. No one really reads these ads. Everyone knows that this is a blatant attempt at shameless publicity. Voters are smart enough to cut through to the real issues.


Tldr - India Shining - part 2 Biggest dumbfuck India has ever witnessed. It's not just TOI, all newspapers including neutral Deccan Herald is also like this from past 1 week. 75% space of first few pages is filled with modi's schemes. It feels like I'm reading some admag nowadays. Can't find any news. What the freak do we buy newspapers for?
 Hey there's some news in your Modi ad, oh wait it's Deepika Padukones padukones This is why I don’t like India’s journalism, and I mostly doubt anything I see online from an Indian news source  I didn't realise it got so bad  EC did not yet announce the election dates. Waiting for Mudi kaka to clear the exchequer money Nothing new about TOI being a biased newspaper. Everyone knows that they would even sell their souls for money. The real question is.... where is the government getting so much money to splurge from? Is this where our taxes go? This is an old post. Seeing only ads when you want to read news makes you pretty pissed off 

But every party, national and state level has been doing it for years. 
Every time before an election, the ruling party does that. What's new this time? This is our tax money mind you.  But this has been the case with every government , especially with Congress.
Neither is there an ombudsman to keep tabs on the press, from their jingoistic party propaganda or their playing loose with facts, nor is the EC currently capable of reigning in political parties, say like when  T.N.Seshan was CEC.

On a different note : We seriously need alternatives to both the BJP and the INC, that aren't AAP. Repost? Newspapers should release an April fools edition where every page is an ad, and on the last page have an ad that says if you want this everyday, go to times of india TOI will become pro Modi now, thanks for offering the pan India govt ad campaign :P Modi Bhai 2020 👌 This paper is of which date ?  This is how newspapers should be. Spreading awareness about achievement of govt. Many people don't even know what good works our govt is doing.

"The Original 10-Year Challenge  ""mera wife ko nahi mera bungalow ko dekho idiots"". 

What an amazing movie that was. Seriously, Chatur killed it. The guy was merciless, cruel and cold blooded genius. Sneaking playboy magazines into dorm rooms before the exam? Damn! Talk about the Art of War. 
 I mean he was living a sweet life, he was clearly a multimillionaire, Phunsuck Wangdu did really well but Chatur did quite well for someone who should be just around 31-32 too. Probably through a ton of hardwork. TBH his methods did take him far. Phunsuck was a natural genius. Who are we kidding? Most of us would kill for a life like Chatur, he is just 32 (since it's been 10 years), for all we care, he could retire with his hot wife and huge mansion and live a sweet life through interests on investments and follow whatever passion he has. Most of us can't be Phunsuck, we can't be absolute geniuses and at least for me, I don't have any crazy passion that would pay me too. So I'd rather become a corporate sellout for a few years and then have enough money to venture into anything I feel like. 

Edit: it's a personal opinion guys, please stop bombarding me with obvious fallacies in my argument. I agree this ain't ideal but it's pragmatic for me.

As a foreigner, I don’t get it [deleted] I didn’t know this guy was in the office :O This is real 10 year challenge.... nice  [deleted] I hate this movie's values with all my heart.

Yes, there is a problem in India: following one's dream is difficult. But how many people you know actually have serious enough dreams AND are exceptional enough to succeed at one thing? In my conversations, the very people who liked the message of the movie and missed not putting it to practice in their own lives failed to name a single thing they \*were\* exceptional at.

The problems that Rancho brings to the front are problems affecting  fewer than perhaps 1% of the school/college-going population. His (overconfident), high-risk methods of dealing with things might work for the next Sachin Tendulkar in present-day Shivaji Park, but are useless, even misleading, to someone who is in the ballpark of average. For the vast majority of us, it would be utterly stupid to use Rancho's advice.   It would be way more rewarding, on average, to be like Chatur, but that character is written to be a laughing stock.

The movie could have posited that Rancho and Chatur are adversaries who are both correct in their own place. Which of the two you favour as a viewer comes down to your own assessment of self-worth. That narrative would have been much more truthful, responsible and not quite 'holier than thou'. Chatur got visited by the Fab Five and had a glow-up Stupid",Non-Political

"Hi r/India! I wanted to share this piece I finished this morning of my granduncle in Punjab  ""Beyond every bend""
oil on canvas
36""x36""

This is painting of my granduncle who I visit almost every year in India. He has always been a very cheerful and jolly man, almost like my own santa growing up.  During my recent visit in 2016, he was not the same.  He would often come around the village with his grandchildren around his shoulders. This time I would go to visit him, in a small room on the side of the road. The room was connected to the larger family house but there was a sense of isolation and exclusion there. 

I think he was alone, away from his family. He had lost about 50 lbs and was not able to communicate any sort of happy expression. He sat up when he saw me but deep down, there was an underlying loneliness I could relate to. It was almost like he was just waiting for the end.

I can relate to that deep sense of not belonging and often try to communicate it through some of my portraiture. It is in many ways baffling to me how we can be moving inward together, at the same time, not knowing we are not going through it alone.  Unfortunately, I feel at times my culture has been a factor in that. Things are often unsaid and misunderstood. I've grown up not knowing how to express internal conflict and struggle because it just wasn't something practiced at the family table. Eventually I would like to create enough work for exhibits and to bring some light to issues of mental health to the general public but also to my own culture.   

The goal of the painting was to portray the overall mood so I started the painting with a large brush to cover the initial layer. 99% of the painting after that was in palette knife. The knife allows me to create movement, texture, and atmosphere in a few sessions instead of having to layer with a brush. I don't know why but this reminds me so much of [this image](http://www.culturalindia.net/iliimages/Bhagat-Singh-ili-24-img-5.jpg) of Bhagat Singh Always loved the Punjabi getup and persona, your granduncle and your painting really personified both! Good going!  Great portrait, OP. Please post this in r/art. They will love it. Man,that's awesome 

Can really sense the sadness(lonliness?) radiating from the painting I can sense the sadness. Unfortunately, humility, empathy, and sympathy is fading away by each day. People care about others more than their own immediate families. As they say, Charity begins at home, but it is rarely practiced.

May Waheguru bless him, as well as you who is showing a deep empathy. We need people like you in our families. Looks like my grandfather 😔😭😣
Beautiful painting  It's beautiful. No words. wow. if its ok with you, may i buy this? 
 Bapu Ji Frame it.. Do you paint professionally?? Do you have a website or something? Do people commission you to do paintings ? Will you be willing ? Sorry for the many questions 
Wonderful painting  Needs more shadow ..Like under the charpai and his feet. He looks like he is floating somewhere on a magic carpet. I think you should keep working on it some more. The piece looks like it's missing something .. like the background and where he is. It's wide enough to not be a portrait so looks a bit empty. I feel the desire to see more of who he is, get a sense of him perhaps with objects around him. Mise en scene ma nigga, mise en scene. Oh hey man! Good to see you back again :)

 It is a nice drawing. Your colors are like a dream bro. 
We want more.  Keep up the great work buddy. After seeing 'Loving Vincent' any painting I see, I see them moving; like literally coming to life. Somehow yours moved and moved me too. 
Thank You. Fuck! This is good! Looks like some real effort went into it,pretty rich and detailed.Great job. Brilliant!  this is beautiful and magical!  great!! love it!! simplicity and sophistication at the same time. This is bloody brilliant. As an ametuer artist, I can only dream of being this damn good. Kudos to you! Absolutely stunning.  OP, this is incredible! you've got to do more (if you already don't, as a career) and start selling them- your blending of colours are spectacular! Amazing!

Will you gift him this? Im not familiar with arts but can anyone explain why people appreciate muddled drawings like this instead of life like looking ones.
 This painting is amazing  Awesome :) Indian Picasso  Beautiful I'd like to see a few actual pictures of him.. maybe one of the people on this sub could help if needed. Really good work, OP. A++ This is beautiful! 
 Very good painting that evokes much feeling. Keep at it! Considering this is in Punjab I have to ask, have drugs affected his life in any way? Don't mean any offence here. 

Edit: changed 'guys' to 'his' to fix typo Beautiful! This is brilliant! This is amazing. He’s so much like my grandfather who lives in Punjab. The calmness and the aura of pind life can’t be matched.  Feels like the weight of the world is on your granduncles shoulders, such a melancholic piece. Being able to feel these emotions just by looking at it shows how awesome that painting is. Good stuff man! Would love to see more of your work. Excellent piece of art👌 Amazing !  Beautiful painting. It truly captures the essence. Good luck to you and your grandfather. Go meet him. Alteast courier a pic of this painting.  Stunning!!! Splendid work! Khatri! Amazing OP. Very nice painting.  Looks cool!  this is really pretty cool - love it Such a beautiful emotive piece, I love it Great work bro Wow amazing Dude you're ridiculously talented. Hope you become a millionaire or something working on commissioned projects and exhibitions.  Blessings and harmony be upon him. This is an awesome work of art. Beautiful  nice work. it seems that the old man is bit sad. What is this style called? Looks very avant-garde. Looks to me like he's reflecting that how he was better off during independence struggle than he is right now in this divisive India . Atleast back then all were united for a cause.  Op, the only thing missing is a sutta in his hands.. brilliant!",Non-Political
"Congratulations to the Indian Women's Rugby Team who have scripted history by registering their First-Ever International 15s Victory by beating Singapore in the Asia Rugby Women's Championship Division 1  We have a Rugby team. Cool. Congrats girls! This is awesome!

It must've been quite a journey for these athletes to compete in an almost unheard of sport (in this country)

I'm glad to see so many more sports come into the limelight in the recent years. Kabadi and football come to mind. Wow! Never knew this sport was played and practised in India. That too at such a high level.

Must have been some struggle for these girls to reach that stage. Hope stuff like this gets more coverage and support in the future.

Congratulations! You girls are the real deal. The fact that some of us didn't even know we had a rugby team shows how unsupportive India is in sports except for cricket. Our gold medal athletes struggle to live while other countries treat them like any other celebrity Strange to see it's a French Bank sponsoring them. Why can't some Indian firms try to sponsor them too. Really proud of their win We even have Rugby🏉 team... Woo...😯 Congratulations! You all are awesome! As a NZ Indian, this warms my heart. Growing up in a semi rural town, rugby and cricket were the most popular sports by far. Love this! And yes, I played rugby in primary school and also intermediate. I was about to comment ""woah we have a rugby team ?"" But most of the comments are same because all we care about cricket and 2 3 other major games and such games are very underrated even govt does not gives shit about any other games besides 3-4 games. We are mentally breaking the these players atleast we have to cheer about them too.
Congrats. Proud of u ladies. Congratulations 🎊 Awesome stuff!!! There is an Indian WOMEN’s rugby team  😳 Heartily congratulations girls. We are proud of you. **Epic Gamer Moment #19** Congratulations Fuck yeah Fuck yeahhh Love to see more countries playing Rugby, Congrats! Image source: https://twitter.com/RugbyIndia/status/1142383368652279808 Yeh meetup kab hua? Well done Team Rugby.... y'all make us proud...
A huge sporting challenge and a beaurucratic one for sure.... swimming against the tide and y'all came out on top.. 
 There's more to sport than cricket !!  Congratulations! Great news... another sport to look into. We leads in cricket and hockey and now I'm Rugby. Hope that continues.

And BTW the growth of Indian football should lead Indian team into world cup. We should defund cricket, its not even an Olympic sport. Those parasites just each butter chicken everyday. We should help support the people actually bringing glory to our nation. Indian women team in rugby as well .. that's just awesome! More power to women !! Interesting part is - now Indian team is playing various games other than cricket & winning them too! Nice *Indian Rugby Team I know cricket is played like crazy in India but I do hope baseball finds it's way in the country.

If people knew the rules , people would love playing that kick ass game too. Win in 5 s. [removed] Who?",Sports
"Not a glitch in the photo, Jama Masjid, Ahmedabad  This picture is breaking my brain. 

&#x200B;

Can't even stare at it without a headache. 

&#x200B;

Folks over at /r/confusing_perspective will love it.  The glitch is in the matrix Ah it felt so nice to see this picture. I was born and raised in ahmedabad, its a special city. I miss it every now and then.  Looks like a temple  Next time keep Vsync ON i don't see it- what's so confusing perspective about this picture  Kem cho badha? Irrespective of whether this was inspired by or built modifying a temple, this style of pillars is important to Hindus. These pillars have three sections - the bottom of square, the middle is octagonal and the upper part is circular. 
The four sided square represents the four faced God bramha. Vishnu is the creator of Bramha and is represented as a square atop a square which is an octagon (he also possesses ashta mangala symbols). Shiva has infinite/no attributes (as you want him to be) and thus is circular. 
Nearly every pillar and Shiva linga in temples (especially in South India) have these three parts. 
There are mosques in Tamil Nadu which were not built after desecrating temples but inspired by local architecture and have such pillars too. Looks like a temple from south india. Nice capture OP! Ques, does it always remains this vacant? I mean I expected a famous mosque to be crowded all times 😅

E: well I am dumb enough to not read the place. Looks more like a temple than a mosque It's not Ahmedabad, it's KARNAVATI! r/blackmagicfuckery Illusion. My head is breaking too.  Totally looks like a glitch! Nice  r/interestingasfuck Wow!! Very nice perspective!

When you take a panorama photo but somebody moves your hand  It took me a while to realise what was even supposed to look like a glitch but now I can't un-see it.

"Today is 26/11  RIP Sandeep Unnikrishnan. Big shout out to our security services who have stopped god knows how many more 26/11 type attacks since that horrible day. Unfortunately we will only ever know about their failures & not their successes. RIP those who died  And recently that motherfucker got released who masterminded the attacks. I was there. My college hostel was about a kilometre from Oberoi, Nariman Point. I was walking on the marine drive with a few friends when shots were fired in Oberoi. Cops arrived soon after and asked us to disperse.

I had a really close escape during the Mumbai local bomb blasts too. Was waiting for a friend at Churchgate station and left a train so we could travel together. There was a blast in the first class compartment of the train that we skipped (we both travelled first class).

Fuck terrorism. Fuck ISI for supporting terrorists. And fuck any Pakistani who supports ISI. Additionally, today is also Constitution Day - When our constitution was adopted. It feels so sad that the conspirators of this horrible horrible event are let free without any consequences, perhaps even more celebrated in their country. 

But events like these remind us that humanity is still alive. 

Corruption was as rampant in 2008 as in any year, a great portion of government officials were troubling the common man as they still do, the police were as complacent as they are today, but all this did not stop the public from saving the victims of Leopold cafe, Taj, CST. Common people, like you and me, gave their lives just so to save others. 
(Great respect to the officials as well)

This aspect of the attacks is something which we should never forget. And the perpetrator of those attacks is scott free and receiving support from many in his country. Sad What a planned timing for the mastermind of this attack to be released. Like a stab in the back. I used to live a couple of streets away from Nariman house. Still remember watching choppers drop the NSG onto an adjacent building; hearing gunshots and grenades. Terrifying experience. My salute to the NSG. Guess what Bollywood and the elite are doing? Throwing a fashion show in its name. As hollow as it can get. This was a sad thing afterall. I was in class 11 that time. For the 3 or 4 days this thing was on, I was perplexed. Life as if was paused. The only thing that you see when you opened TV was this. 

There were two events in Indian media that actually changed things - this and the Nirbhaya gang rape. Both were heavily publicized, to the point that the govt actually moved it ass and took some action. 

What's more sadder is that this thing is a reality even today. Just a couple of days ago, a blast happened in Egypt, taking lives of over 300 people, double the amount of 26/11. A population of size of a small colony in India gone, at an instant. 

Since 26/11, I have studied history of Islam and middle East extensively, read tens of books, to know answers I have always wanted to know - Why? I am more confused than before. It just doesn't get in my head, how a person, who is mostly peaceful at first, and living in communities of mostly peaceful people, can transform himself to become a monster and fill himself with hatred. 

Terrorism because of insurgency I can understand and get my head around - Kashmir, North East, etc. Strapping a bomb and killing normal civilians - who have nothing to do with you? That part I will never be able to get into my head.  1. Best friends brother in law lost his eye ( behind Stock Market 1992 Bombing) - this is 23 years

I was married to a Pakistani, a Hindu - 20 years ago, they are not sensitive towards our feeling, they think this is a joke - my ex passed on a comment near her friend about how our countries should make up and ""hum becharo ko Dawood mil jaye"", I spoke to her about it and how this is not a joke ( they left Pakistan coz of ill treatment towards Hindus even for upper middle class, but when your born in a place, your feeling are tied towards it. My divorce was not due to political reasons FYI ) and if you ever saw live comments on Youtube on 26/11, a decent Pakistani would be ashamed of his countrymen on the filth and happiness shown by them. I still don't blame every Pakistani, just a general viewpoint that they feel we did this to ourselves and even if some died, no big deal coz we are doing so many in Kashmir.
This Saeed is just one small pawn in a bigger scheme of things, Pakistani govt has done far worse in the past - this is just another killer they are sleeping with Don't forget news media channels that live streamed this incident compromising security forces. They have blood on their hands. A big thank you from the entire country to all the heroes who saved us. NEVER FORGET  Just thankful to the authorities for keeping us safe since. I don't think we have had any incident in the past 5-6 years at least. When tragedies happen in other countries, say 9/11 they are honored every year and people who suffered in the tragedy are remembered.

I have been on social media all day and didn't see one post about this, it's fucking sad man I remember I was 8 when it happened. My first brush with terror with some conscience. I still didn't understand the scale of the attacks even a bit, but going back later, seeing documentaries, it was really gut-wrenching. RIP those innocent...  I hope the government officials become aware of the repercussions of their complacent and careless attitude and start giving priority to security of not only VIPs but also ordinary citizens. Healing is good, but some people just want to see the world burn. The bastard terrorist Hafiz Said was freed today by terror state pakistan. Looks like the move was well planned. Purposely set free on the day our motherland India faced the worst attack.

Karma will definitely strike back. Terror state Pakistan will surely have to pay the consequences. Jai Hind ! NSG❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ They literally broke records saving people.  I had read somewhere they had pulled the longest operation of that kind in history Rest In Peace all of who perished in this act of cowardice  Remember this day like it was yesterday. And then the next four days when it wouldn't end. I would wake up everyday hoping that it was over, but it just wasn't.  Today is my birthday :/ Fuck Islamic Terrorism. Fuck infidels. Fuck those religious retards.  The day which broke the heart of the country..!! RIP Brave Martyrs hope it never happens again  What happened? Salute to those who put their lives to save ours. Jai Hind!!! Salute to all those brave men and may their soul rest in peace. Rip to all the victims I think this needs a little more context since it reached frontpage. To those interested, I recommend watching this [PBS Frontline documentary that goes through the events leading to India's worst ever terrorist attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xkTa_EH-3g), and its connection with one Pakistan born American citizen. I haven't found a better documentary on the subject yet, definitely not from Indian media.  Read Black Tornado for the the detailed account of this incident.  The politicians knew and didn't even stop this. So many lives would have been saved. Also my birthday RIP to all our brave sons of this country who sacrificed their lifes for this country.  this the new thing you ALWAYS see what other man doing arround 
you Fuckers attacked my Sunday brunch spot. To hell with them.  And India is still not equipped to handle attack like this if it happens ever. Pathankot showed us that.
